URL AND TITLE</br></br>Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are emerging zoonotic diseases caused by SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 infections, respectively. These CoVs belong to the β-coronavirus genus, and they can cause severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) with multi-organ failure, resulting in a high fatality rate.\nMERS-CoV is transmitted from dromedary camels and/or bats to the human population [1]. Primary infection has typically occurred in Middle Eastern countries; however, the 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak centered on South Korea. This indicated that the emerging viral infection is not predictable, and thus, this virus should not be solely considered a domestic issue. Although MERS-CoV infection has a high mortality rate, no approved therapeutics or vaccines have been developed to date. Therefore, in 2018, the World Health Organization sought to accelerate antiviral research and development of treatments for MERS-CoV [2].\nMERS-CoV has a large, positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome of 30.1 kb that expresses both structural and nonstructural proteins. MERS-CoV RNA is inserted into cells via dipeptidyl peptidase 4-mediated endocytosis, and it carries two polyprotein genes (pp1a and pp1ab) that can be transcribed into 16 nonstructural proteins (NSPs) necessary for viral replication and transcription [3]. MERS-CoV polyproteins are self-cleaved into papain-like protease (PLpro) and 3C-like protease (3CLpro), which subsequently cleave the polyproteins to produce the replicative enzymes RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), helicase, and exonuclease [4]. Among them, MERS-CoV RdRp is a 106.9-kDa protein encoded by the nsp12 gene that is expressed early in the course of infection and is critical for viral replication [5].\nSuppression of MERS-CoV replication by inhibiting MERS-CoV NSPs has been one of the primary antiviral strategies against MERS-CoV infection. Liang et al. recently reviewed several PLpro and 3CLpro inhibitors [6], and the MERS-CoV helicase inhibitor was SSYA10-001, initially developed as a helicase inhibitor of SARS-CoV [7]. However, antivirals targeting MERS-CoV RdRp have not been reported. Nucleoside analogs commonly target viral replication, particularly viral polymerase [8], and they have succeeded clinically in treatment of multiple viral infectious diseases [9]. For example, hepatitis C virus (HCV) RdRp inhibitors have achieved high success rates in clinical treatment [10]. Ribavirin triphosphate inhibits HCV RdRp [11], and sofosbuvir is a nucleotide analog that is inserted into HCV RNA by HCV RdRp, acting as a chain terminator [12]. Dasabuvir is a non-nucleoside HCV NS5B inhibitor that binds to the palm domain of HCV RdRp and induces a conformational change [13]. Therefore, MERS-CoV RdRp inhibition could represent an optimal antiviral strategy.\nRibavirin and remdesivir (GS-5734) are the representative nucleoside analogs that inhibit in vitro MERS-CoV infection [5,14]. To the best of our knowledge, the inhibitory effect of ribavirin on MERS-CoV RdRp activity has not yet been evaluated. The target of remdesivir in treating coronavirus infection was suggested to be the resistance mutation of viral polymerase in mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV [5]. It was recently reported that the triphosphate form of remdesivir inhibits MERS-CoV RdRp by using an enzyme activity assay in a cell-free system [15]. However, there is no report describing an antiviral compound that suppresses MERS-CoV RdRp activity in a cell-based reporter assay system.\nLee et al. previously established a cell-based reporter assay system using HCV NS5B and a bicistronic reporter gene, which they used for HCV RdRp inhibitor screening by measuring intracellular HCV RdRp activity [16]. We established a cell-based MERS-CoV RdRp reporter assay system by modifying the previously developed system. Then, we evaluated the inhibitory effect of various viral polymerase inhibitors, including HCV RdRp, negative-strand influenza virus polymerase, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reverse transcriptase, and herpes simplex virus (HSV) DNA polymerase, on MERS-CoV RdRp activity and investigated the reproducibility and reliability of this assay for expanded application in high-throughput screening (HTS). We confirmed remdesivir as a direct MERS-CoV RdRp inhibitor using the cell-based assay and it suggested that the newly established cell-based reporter assay is suitable for the rapid and accurate screening of specific MERS-CoV RdRp inhibitors.\nFavipiravir (PubChem CID: 492405), sofosbuvir (PubChem CID: 45375808), and Dasabuvir (PubChem CID: 56640146) were purchased from Chemscene LLC (Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA). Ribavirin (PubChem CID: 37542), valacyclovir hydrochloride (PubChem CID: 135398741), vidarabine monohydrate (PubChem CID: 32326), lamivudine (PubChem CID: 60825), and zidovudine (PubChem CID: 35370) were purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry CO., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Remdesivir (PubChem CID: 121304016) was purchased from LALPharm Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). Quality control of remdesivir was guaranteed by the supplier based on HPLC-Mass spec and NMR analysis data, and we re-verified these findings before experimentation. All compounds were stored as 20-mM stock solutions in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).\nThe N-terminal (N-term) or C-terminal (C-term) Flag-tagged MERS-CoV nsp12 gene, the C-term Flag-tagged nsp7 gene, nsp7 gene, C-term Flag-tagged nsp8 gene, and nsp8 gene (GenBank® accession no. KT029139) were human codon-optimized, synthesized via GENEWIZ (South Plainfield, NJ, USA), and cloned into the NheI and XhoI sites of the pcDNA3.1(+) plasmid (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA) to generate pN-termFlag-nsp12 or pC-termFlag-nsp12 plasmids, pC-termFlag-nsp7 plasmid, pNsp7 plasmid, pC-termFlag-nsp8 plasmid, and pNsp8 plasmid, respectively. To generate the reporter plasmid, we modified the previously published bicistronic HCV RdRp reporter construct [16]. The sense orientation (+) firefly luciferase gene (FLuc) was amplified by PCR from pGL3-basic (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA, GenBank® accession no. U47295) and cloned into the NheI and HindIII sites of the pcDNA3.1(+) plasmid. Subsequently, the hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme sequence, antisense 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of MERS-CoV, antisense Nano-glo® luciferase gene (NLuc) (Promega Corporation, GenBank® accession no. KM359770), antisense 5′-UTR of MERS-CoV (with/without HCV internal ribosome entry site (IRES) sequence), and HDV ribozyme sequence were synthesized in a row via GENEWIZ and cloned into the HindIII and XhoI sites downstream of the (+)FLuc gene to generate the p(+)FLuc-(−)UTR-NLuc reporter plasmid (with or without the antisense HCV IRES sequence between (−)5′-UTR and (−)NLuc sequence). p(+)FLuc-(−)UTR-NLuc, the reporter plasmid for the MERS-CoV RdRp activity assay, is presented in Figure 1.\nHEK293T cells (30 passages) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). These cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’ medium (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For transient transfection, HEK293T cells were seeded at 96-well plates (Corning) overnight. Plasmids were mixed with TransIT®-LT1 transfection reagent (Mirus Bio LLC, Madison, WI, USA) and the plasmid and reagent mixture were added to cells according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nHEK293T cells were seeded in 24-well plates and transfected with pN-termFlag-nsp12 or pC-termFlag-nsp12 plasmids. After 24 h, cells were lysed in Glo Lysis Buffer (Promega Corporation). Lysates were separated via 8% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). The membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline with Tween 20 (PBST) for 30 min at room temperature, rinsed with PBST, and incubated with antibodies against FLAG (Cat no. ab125243, Lot no. GR3205413-1, Abcam plc, Cambridge, UK) or β-actin (Cat no. 3700S, Lot no. 15, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, MA, USA) at 4 °C overnight. After three washes with PBST, membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cat no. ab6728, Lot no. GR3200472-2, Abcam plc) for 1 h, and detection was performed with Enhanced Chemiluminescence Western Blotting Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) using the ChemiDoc™ Touch Imaging System (Bio-Rad Laboratories).\nHEK293T cells were seeded into 96-well plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) overnight and then treated with the indicated compounds for 18 h. Cytotoxicity was measured using the CellTiter 96® AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega Corporation) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 490 nm using a GloMax® Discover Microplate Reader (Promega Corporation).\nHEK293T cells were seeded in 96-well plates overnight and transfected with pN-termFlag-nsp12 and p(+)FLuc-(−)UTR-NLuc reporter plasmids for 24 h. Cells were treated with the test compounds or 0.25% DMSO (control), starting 6 h after transfection. FLuc and NLuc reporter gene expression in these cells was measured using a Nano-Glo® Dual-Luciferase® Reporter Assay System (Promega Corporation) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The relative activity of MERS-CoV RdRp was determined by normalizing the level of NLuc activity to that of FLuc (NLuc/FLuc ratio). The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50), which denoted the concentration at which NLuc activity was reduced by 50% compared with the control level, was measured using linear interpolation.\nTo assess the reliability and reproducibility of the developed assay, Z-factor and Z′-factor values were evaluated using the method of Zhang et al. [17]. First, we executed the assay as mentioned previously, and the experimental grouping was as follows: (1) negative group (n = 40 wells), treated with 0.025% DMSO following the dual transfection of p(+)FLuc-(−)UTR-NLuc and pcDNA3.1 (control vector); (2) positive group (n = 40 wells), treated with 0.025% DMSO following the dual transfection of p(+)FLuc-(−)UTR-NLuc and pN-termFlag-nsp12; and (3) inhibitor group (n = 40 wells); treated with 12 μM remdesivir following the dual transfection of p(+)FLuc-(−)UTR-NLuc and pN-termFlag-nsp12. Z-factor was calculated using the following equation: Z-factor = 1 − [(3SDNegative + 3SDPositive)/|meanNegative − meanPositive|]. Z′-factor was calculated as follows: Z′-factor = 1 − [(3SDInhibitor + 3SDPositive)/|meanInhibitor − meanPositive|]. For both formulae, the standard deviation and mean values of each group correspond to the relative NLuc activity obtained from each group.\nThe data were presented as the mean ± SEM. Statistical comparison of luciferase activities by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparison’s test and two-tailed Student’s t-test, and non-linear regression analysis of IC50 and CC50 were conducted using GraphPad Prism® Software V.6.05 for Windows (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). p values of less than 0.05 were indicated statistically significant.\nTo develop the cell-based MERS-CoV RdRp activity reporter assay, we modified the previously reported cell-based HCV RdRp activity assay [16]. The cell-based reporter system used the bicistronic reporter construct p(+)FLuc-(−)UTR-NLuc, which contains the firefly luciferase gene in the sense orientation, (+)FLuc and Nano-glo® luciferase in the antisense orientation, and (−)NLuc, which is flanked by the antisense 3′- and 5′-UTR of MERS-CoV and the hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme self-cleavage sequence.\nThe full length of bicistronic (+)FLuc-(−)UTR-NLuc RNA is transcribed by the host cellular DNA-dependent RNA polymerase Pol II. The transcripts are processed by HDV ribozyme self-cleavage, and the exposed negative strand of NLuc flanked by the antisense 3′- and 5′-UTR RNA can be replicated by MERS-CoV RdRp. Then, the replicated positive strand of NLuc RNA is translated, and the expression level of NLuc represents the activity of MERS-CoV RdRp. The expression level of FLuc serves as an internal control of transcription/translation to minimize the variation among samples. p(+)FLuc-(−)UTR-NLuc and the concept of the cell-based MERS-CoV RdRp activity assay are presented in Figure 1.\nTo express MERS-CoV RdRp in a human cell line, we generated the human codon-optimized FLAG-tagged MERS-CoV nsp12 plasmid construct. It was previously reported that the N-term foreign sequence of the poliovirus RdRp affected polymerase activity because the N-term was important for protein folding and the positioning of the active site [18,19]. Therefore, we generated pN-termFlag-nsp12 and pC-termFlag-nsp12 plasmids and compared the expression and activity of MERS-CoV RdRp. We confirmed the expression of N-term or C-term FLAG MERS-CoV RdRp at a molecular weight of approximately 110 kDa following transient transfection with pN-termFlag-nsp12 or pC-termFlag-nsp12 plasmids (Figure 2A).\nTo compare the activity of N-term or C-term FLAG-tagged MERS-CoV RdRp, luminescence was measured in HEK293T cells co-transfected with p(+)FLuc-(−)UTR-NLuc. The relative NLuc activity was increased by the expression of N-term or FLAG-tagged MERS-CoV RdRp in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2B), and the luciferase activities were comparable. Therefore, we found that the N-term FLAG tag did not interrupt the activity of MERS-CoV RdRp. Furthermore, the relative NLuc activity of N-term FLAG-tagged MERS-CoV RdRp (5.91 ± 0.14-fold with 80 ng of plasmid) was significantly higher than that of C-term FLAG-tagged MERS-CoV RdRp (3.9 ± 0.26-fold with 80 ng of plasmid). Thus, we used the pN-termFlag-nsp12 plasmid for the cell-based MERS-CoV RdRp activity reporter assay system in the present study.\nIn the previous cell-based HCV RdRp activity assay, the HCV 5′-UTR comprised an IRES element, which is important for the second cistron luciferase protein translation after HCV NS5B polymerase replicates the positive-strand luciferase RNA [16]. Because we used the MERS-CoV 5′-UTR for the MERS-CoV RdRp reporter assay, we generated p(+)FLuc-(−)UTR-NLuc with or without the antisense HCV IRES element between the (−)5′-UTR and (−)NLuc sequence and then compared the relative NLuc activity of MERS-CoV RdRp. When we transfected p(+)FLuc-(−)UTR-NLuc with or without the antisense HCV IRES element plasmid and pN-termFlag-nsp12 plasmid into HEK293T cells, the relative NLuc activity was compromised by co-transfection of p(+)FLuc-(−)UTR-NLuc and the antisense HCV IRES element plasmid transfection compared with that for p(+)FLuc-(−)UTR-NLuc without the antisense HCV IRES element (Figure 2C). Therefore, we found that the MERS-CoV 5′-UTR does not need the HCV IRES sequence to translate the NLuc protein. \nIt was reported that SARS-CoV needs the interacting proteins, nsp8 and nsp7, to have the activity in the enzymatic activity assay because the SARS-CoV nsp8 subunit that forms a hexadecameric complex with nsp7 functions as a RNA primase [20,21]. So, we generated human codon-optimized nsp7 or nsp 8 with or without C-terminal Flag-tagged expression vectors and compared the activity of MERS-CoV RdRp with or without nsp7 and nsp8 protein by determining the relative NLuc activity of MERS-CoV RdRp in this system. After transient transfection with pN-termFlag-nsp12, pC-termFlag-nsp7 and pC-termFlag-nsp8 plasmids, we confirmed the expression of N-term Flag-tagged MERS-CoV RdRp, and the expression of C-term Flag-tagged nsp8 at a molecular weight of approximately 23 kDa (Figure 2D). However, we could not detect the C-term Flag-tagged nsp7 proteins by Western blot analysis in our system. Then, in this cell-based system, the addition of the nsp8 and nsp7 proteins with or without C-terminal Flag tag did not have any significant effect on the relative NLuc activity (Figure 2E). We also suggested the control experiment in cells transfected with the other viral protein, nsp5 plasmid, instead of the nsp12-expressing plasmid, to rule out a possible role of host enzymes in the outcome (Figure S1). Taken together, we finally elected p(+)FLuc-(−)UTR-NLuc, without the antisense HCV IRES element, and pN-termFlag-nsp12, without the addition of nsp7 and nsp8 plasmids, for the cell-based MERS-CoV RdRp activity reporter assay system as the optimized condition.\nTo identify nucleoside analogs that could directly target MERS-CoV RdRp activity, drugs including ribavirin, sofosbuvir, favipiravir, lamivudine, zidovudine, valacyclovir, and vidarabine were examined using the optimized assay system.\nRibavirin is a guanosine analog and a broad-spectrum antiviral approved for the treatment of RSV [22], HCV [23], Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, Lassa virus, and Hantavirus infection based on its ability to prevent viral RNA synthesis [24]. Previous research reported that ribavirin inhibited in vitro MERS-CoV infection in Vero RML6 and LLC-MK2 cells with IC50 values of 41.45 and 13.26 μg/ml, respectively [14]. In the present study, 100 μM ribavirin inhibited MERS-CoV RdRp activity by approximately 40% (Figure 3A, Table 1). Sofosbuvir is a clinically approved uridine nucleotide that blocks the HCV NS5B protein, also known as RdRp [25]. However, 100 μM sofosbuvir also only inhibited MERS-CoV RdRp activity by approximately 40% (Figure 3B, Table 1).\nFavipiravir (T-705) acts as a purine analog and inhibits the influenza viral polymerase by inducing lethal RNA transversion mutations [26]. Although favipiravir has known to inhibit the RdRp protein in various RNA viruses [27], it only reduced MERS-CoV RdRp activity by approximately 10% at a concentration of 100 μM (Figure 3C, Table 1). Lamivudine and zidovudine are nucleoside analogs that act as reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and they have been used to inhibit HIV infection [28]. However, neither drug reduced MERS-CoV RdRp activity at concentrations of up to 100 μM (Figure 3D,E, Table 1). We also tested the nucleoside analogs and viral DNA polymerase inhibitors valacyclovir and vidarabine, which inhibit HSV infection [29]. Neither drug inhibited MERS-CoV RdRp activity at concentrations of up to 100 μM (Figure 3F,G, Table 1). Especially vidarabine did not exert cytotoxicity (Figure S2H); however, concentration-dependent decreases of both FLuc and NLuc activity were unpredictably observed. This finding suggests that vidarabine inhibits host transcription/translation processes, but vidarabine had no effect on the NLuc/FLuc ratio or MERS-CoV RdRp activity.\nDasabuvir is a derivative of benzothiadiazine (Figure 4A) that functions as a non-nucleoside inhibitor of HCV NS5B [13] by interacting with the conserved amino acids localized near the active site of the HCV NS5B palm domain [30]. We found that 10 μM dasabuvir reduced MERS-CoV RdRp activity by approximately 50% without any cytotoxicity and the IC50 was 11.606 μM according to non-linear regression analysis (Figure 4C,D), whereas cytotoxicity and reduced firefly luciferase activity were observed at concentrations exceeding 10 μM and the half-maximal cytotoxic concentration of dasabuvir was 27.143 μM in HEK293T cells (Figure 4B). Therefore, we <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightblue; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">could<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">ideas</span>\n</mark> not detect the complete inhibition of MERS-CoV RdRp activity by dasabuvir.\n <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightorange; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">Remdesivir<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">chemical</span>\n</mark> is a monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine analog (Figure 5A). In prior research, remdesivir inhibited MERS-CoV infection in vitro with an IC50 of 0.074 ± 0.023 μM in human airway epithelial (HAE) cells, and remdesivir targets RdRp and exoribonuclease (nsp14, ExoN) in MHV, suggesting resistance mutation [5]. Therefore, we evaluated the direct inhibitory effects of remdesivir on MERS-CoV RdRp activity. The drug was demonstrated to reduce the relative NLuc activity in a dose-dependent manner while maintaining consistent FLuc activity, and no cytotoxicity was observed at concentrations of up to 12μM (Figure 5B,C). The IC50 of remdesivir was 5.028 ± 0.035 μM according to non-linear regression analysis (Figure 5D). There is the discrepancy between remdesivir IC50 of 0.074 ± 0.023 μM in MERS-CoV infected HAE cells and IC50 of 5.028 ± 0.035 μM in this system, which may be due to the different experimental conditions, using the artificially over-expressed MERS-CoV RdRp compared with using the infectious virus.\nThe Z-factor is the most widely used parameter in the evaluation and validation of HTS experiments [31]. In the present study, Z-factor was calculated using the relative NLuc activity obtained from the negative and positive groups to evaluate the discriminant ability of the assay for MERS-CoV RdRp activity. In addition, Z′-factor was calculated using data obtained from the positive and inhibitor groups to evaluate the applicability of remdesivir as a positive control for MERS-CoV RdRp inhibition. We obtained Z-factor and Z′-factor values of 0.778 and 0.782, respectively, indicating that the cell-based MERS-CoV RdRp activity reporter assay system reliably and reproducibly identifies MERS-CoV RdRp inhibitors in HTS systems (Figure 6).\nRdRp is one of the most important viral proteins of RNA viruses for RNA synthesis, and it has been suggested as a valuable target for the development of antiviral therapeutics. In the present study, we established a cell-based MERS-CoV RdRp activity reporter assay system by modifying the previously reported cell-based HCV RdRp activity assay [16]. This system consists of the bicistronic MERS-CoV RdRp reporter construct p(+)FLuc-(−)UTR-NLuc and pN-termFlag-nsp12 plasmid. The expression level of FLuc serves as an internal control, and the expression level of NLuc represents the activity of MERS-CoV RdRp. Because the N-term of RdRp is known to be important for protein folding and the positioning of the active site [18,19], we compared MERS-CoV RdRp activity between N-term and C-term FLAG-tagged RdRp, finding that the N-term FLAG tag did not interrupt the activity of MERS-CoV RdRp. We also found that the MERS-CoV 5′-UTR did not need the HCV IRES sequence for second cistron protein translation. Therefore, we finally selected p(+)FLuc-(−)UTR-NLuc without the HCV IRES element and pN-termFlag-nsp12 for the present assay system.\nTo assess RdRp enzyme activity using the purified recombinant RdRp protein, RNA template, RNA primer, and isotopic NTP are prepared for reaction, and radioisotope-labeling RNA products synthesized in a test tube are usually measured. In this case, there may be technical barriers that restrict the purification of a highly pure and bioactive RdRp protein, optimization of the RNA synthesis reaction conditions, and treatment using radioactive materials with guaranteed biosafety. However, the cell-based reporter assay system can overcome these difficulties, and the FLuc expression level, which serves as an internal control, directly indicates the cytotoxicity of test compounds, as observed for dasabuvir. Particularly, this system can determine whether the test compound affects host transcription/translation processes or specifically inhibits MERS-CoV RdRp activity. Moreover, we can screen the prodrug form of candidates, such as remdesivir, without the conversion process to obtain the pharmacologically active form because this system uses human cells.\nSARS-CoV RdRp is known to be primer-dependent [32] and to need the interacting proteins, nsp8 and nsp7, in enzyme activity assay because the CoV nsp8 subunit that forms a hexadecameric complex with nsp7 functions as a RNA primase [20,21]. We also tested if nsp8 and nsp7 acts as the co-factors of RdRp’s gene synthesis. However, the nsp8 and nsp7 proteins did not give any significant effect on the activity of MERS-CoV RdRp in this cell-based system. Although we could not detect the expression of nsp7 protein in our system, it is consistent that when the MERS-CoV nsp12, nsp7, and nsp8 were co-expressed in insect cell system with nsp5 as a polyprotein, cleaved by the nsp5 protease, only nsp8 and nsp12, but not nsp7 were detected by SDS PAGE analysis and Mass spectroscopy [15]. Results were also published which found that SARS-CoV nsp12 purified in E.coli has primer–independent, de novo RNA synthesis activity without nsp7 and nsp8 proteins using viral RNA template containing the 3’ UTR of +/- strands of the SARS-CoV [33]. The mechanisms of RNA synthesis of coronaviruses have not well characterized in cell biology, so further studies are needed in more detail.\nUsing this system, we tested nucleoside/nucleotide analogs such as ribavirin, sofosbuvir, favipiravir, lamivudine, zidovudine, valacyclovir, vidarabine, and remdesivir, as well as the non-nucleoside analog dasabuvir, because they commonly target viral DNA or RNA polymerase [8]. Among them, the reverse transcriptase inhibitors lamivudine and zidovudine and DNA polymerase inhibitors valacyclovir and vidarabine did not significantly inhibit MERS-CoV RdRp activity. Meanwhile, favipiravir is known to selectively inhibit the PA protein of the influenza virus polymerase, which consists of three viral proteins (PA, PB1, and PB2), and induce lethal RNA transversion mutations, thereby producing a non-viable viral phenotype [26]. Despite acting as an active inhibitor against positive-stranded RNA viral RdRp [27], favipiravir only had weak inhibitory effects on MERS-CoV RdRp activity in our assay.\nRibavirin is a guanosine analog that functions as a broad-spectrum antiviral, and the drug was reported to interact with host inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, which prevents viral RNA synthesis by depleting cellular guanosine triphosphate [34]. The incorporation of ribavirin triphosphate by RdRp also results in lethal viral mutagenesis [35]. Although ribavirin inhibited MERS-CoV infection in Vero RML6 and LLC-MK2 cells [14], these findings have failed to translate into clinical benefits in patients with MERS-CoV [36]. Our results illustrated that ribavirin only partially inhibited MERS-CoV RdRp activity, which could explain its failure in clinical trials.\nSofosbuvir is an uridine nucleotide analog that directly blocks the HCV NS5B protein (RdRp) and then inhibits RNA synthesis [25]. Our results indicated that this drug also partially inhibited MERS-CoV RdRp activity. We also examined the effect of the non-nucleoside HCV NS5B inhibitor dasabuvir [13], a derivative of benzothiadiazine, which interacts with the active site of the HCV NS5B palm domain [30]. The present assay illustrated that dasabuvir suppressed MERS-CoV RdRp activity at a low concentration, but full inhibition of the enzyme could not be observed because of toxicity at concentrations exceeding 10 μM. Although the sequence of viral RdRp in RNA viruses is versatile, the core structure of RdRp is conserved [37]. Moreover, alignment of the RdRp sequences between MERS-CoV and HCV revealed that the active site and its backbone site are conserved, suggesting that HCV RdRp inhibitors act also MERS-CoV RdRp inhibitors in a similar manner and to a similar extent [38]. However, ribavirin and sofosbuvir only partially inhibited MERS-CoV RdRp activity, whereas dasabuvir had stronger effects. These data indicate that HCV RdRp inhibitors do not universally inhibit MERS-CoV RdRp activity despite conservation of the active site between the viruses.\n <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightorange; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">Remdesivir<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">chemical</span>\n</mark> is a novel adenosine analog developed for <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightgreen; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">treating<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">usages</span>\n</mark> Ebola virus infection as a chain terminator of viral RdRp [39], and it is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug with activity against RNA viruses including MHV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV [5]. The target of remdesivir in coronaviruses was previously suggested to be the viral polymerase and ExoN of MHV based on the presence of remdesivir resistance mutations in the RdRp of MHV and an MHV mutant lacking ExoN, which is more susceptible to the drug [5]. Although remdesivir widely inhibits infection by coronaviruses with divergent RdRp sequences [40], this is the first study to demonstrate that remdesivir acts as a direct inhibitor of MERS-CoV RdRp activity expressed in the human cells based on its dose-dependent effects in a cell-based reporter assay.\nWe quantified the accuracy of this assay system by calculating Z-factor and Z′-factor, which are the most widely used parameters for evaluating and validating HTS experiments [31]. The present data indicated that this system is excellent for screening inhibitors of MERS-CoV RdRp activity. To avoid transient transfection experiment, we will generate the stable cell line harboring the reporter construct for the convenience of HTS experiments\nWe established a cell-based reporter assay for MERS-CoV RdRp activity to test viral polymerase inhibitors. Of the tested inhibitors, the cell-based reporter assay for MERS-CoV RdRp activity confirmed remdesivir as a direct inhibitor of MERS-CoV RdRp, and we clarified that this system is an accurate and useful HTS tool for screening specific and effective MERS-CoV RdRp inhibitors. Therefore, this system may provide a valuable platform for the development of effective antiviral therapeutics against MERS-CoV infection.</br></br>UNKNOWN URL AND TITLE</br></br>Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), represents a major global public health threat. At the time of writing this report, COVID-19 has been detected in over 200 countries/regions with over 4 million confirmed cases and nearly 300,000 deaths (Johns Hopkins University, 2020). Although, rates of new cases have plateaued in some regions due to social distancing measures, transmission dynamics suggest that, in the absence of a vaccine, a combination of intermittent social distancing, an expanded critical care capacity, and an effective therapeutic treatment will be necessary to facilitate acquisition of sufficient herd immunity to mitigate resurgence of infection in the near future (Kissler et al., 2020).\nSARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the β genus of the Coronaviridae family. The SARS-CoV-2 virion consists of at least four (4) structural proteins: Spike (S) protein, membrane (M) protein, envelope (E) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein (Li et al., 2020). The Spike (S) protein confers the distinguishing “crown” appearance consistent with other coronaviruses and facilitates binding and viral entry with host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor (Ge et al., 2013). It is also the target for neutralizing antibodies and vaccines (Du et al., 2009). In contrast, some key non-structural proteins include: Papain like protease (PLpro) and Main protease (Mpro), which are responsible for cleavage of viral polypeptide into functional units; and RNA-dependent RNApolymerase (RdRp), which is critical for viral proliferation (Ziebuhr et al., 2000). Expectedly, these proteins have been identified as important drug targets (Dong et al., 2020).\nCurrently, there is no confirmed treatment or vaccine prevention strategy against COVID-19. Due to the urgency of the situation, drug repurposing is widely accepted as the fastest way to identify possible effective therapeutic options (Ciliberto & Cardone, 2020; Ekins et al., 2020; Parks & Smith, 2020). Clinical trials have investigated the efficacy of various existing drugs for possible repurposing, including Lopinavir/Ritonavir (anti-HIV protease inhibitors), (Cao et al., 2020), hydroxychloroquine (anti-malarial which decreases acidity in endosomes and probably affects the entry of the virus to the cell) and Azithromycin (an antibacterial agent) (Molina et al., 2020; Rosenberg et al., 2020), and <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightorange; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">Remdesivir<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">chemical</span>\n</mark> (a 1′-cyano-substituted adenosine nucleotide analogue prodrug with established activity <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightgreen; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">against<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">usages</span>\n</mark> Ebola virus RdRp) (Shah et al., 2020; Tchesnokov et al., 2019).

In-silico drug screening techniques and experienced docking experiments allow for the evaluation of available drug candidates against viral protein and host receptor structures (Ekins et al., 2007; Hodos et al., 2016). It is a fast, and cost-effective way of identifying new uses for old drugs and has been successful in identifying drugs for a variety of conditions (Ekins et al., 2007). Since the structures of SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins were characterized and published in early February, 2020, there has been a surge of in silico studies seeking potential drugs that could be repurposed to treat COVID-19(Mohamed et al., 2020). One drug that may hold potential is Cefuroxime.\nThere have been several anecdotal accounts on social media of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients who received oral Cefuroxime experiencing often rapid symptomatic improvement (Aquino, 2020; Barreto, 2020; Sheathomas, 2020; Sur, 2020; Turnipseed, 2020). Cefuroxime is a second generation cephalosporin antibiotic. It has broad spectrum activity and is commonly used for the treatment of both upper and lower respiratory tract infections, Lyme disease, and genitourinary tract infections. It is readily available and affordable, and it exists in both oral and parenteral forms as Cefuroxime Axetil and Cefuroxime Sodium, respectively. It has undergone extensive toxicological investigation and post-marketing surveillance and it is known to have a good safety profile (Emmerson, 1988). The most common adverse events are gastrointestinal disturbances including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. (Emmerson, 1988; O'Callaghan et al., 1976; Perry & Brogden, 1996), which is estimated to occur in between 3% to 4% of recipients (Perry & Brogden, 1996). Other less common side effects include headaches, hypersensitivity reactions, hematological derangements, pseudomembranous colitis, vaginitis, and skin rashes, all of which appear to be dose-dependent (Gold & Rodriguez, 1983; Perry & Brogden, 1996). The aim of this paper is to identify and summarize available in silico evidence for the molecular basis of possible activity of Cefuroxime against SARS-CoV-2.\nWe adopted the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines (Tricco et al., 2018). Eligible studies were identified through search of articles published in Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar from February 1st, 2020 through May 15th. We employed a broad search strategy for peer-reviewed databases by using the following search key; ‘(“in silico” or “virtual screening” or “computational”) and (“SARS-CoV-2” or “coronavirus” or “COVID 19”) and (“drugs” or “drug repurposing”)’. Given that Google Scholar allows for searching within full-text, we employed a directed search strategy using the search key: ‘Cefuroxime AND (“Coronavirus” or “COVID19” or “SARS-CoV-2”) and drug repurposing’.\nPrimary research articles, written in English, that fulfilled the following criteria were included in the analysis: i) described testing of potential inhibitors of any SARS-CoV-2, structural or non-structural proteins, ii) included screening of potential inhibitor drugs from a drug library containing United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs or pre-selected list that included Cefuroxime, and iii) identified Cefuroxime as a top-ranked (top X drugs, where X < = 20) potential inhibitor drug. Studies with any of the following were excluded from analysis: i) articles that did not report results of primary research, ii) articles not written in English, iii) studies that investigated only natural or traditional drugs, iv) studies that described testing of specific drugs or a pre-selected drugs list that did not include Cefuroxime v) studies that did not identify Cefuroxime as a top-ranked potential inhibitor drug.\nTwo investigators (AD and CW) independently searched and reviewed the titles and the abstracts of the retrieved studies to identify potentially relevant articles. The full text publications of potentially relevant articles were retrieved and re-screened by the same two investigators. Disagreements were resolved by consensus between the two investigators. The final selected articles were reviewed, data extracted, and the methodology and findings were summarized in this paper.\nThe primary study outcome was to identify and summarize in silico evidence that suggest a molecular basis of possible activity of Cefuroxime against SARS-CoV-2.\nData from each eligible study were extracted by the two investigators. Extracted data included the name of first author, country of origin of corresponding author, peer reviewed status, methodological approach, software tool used, FDA approved drugs or drug library screened, SARS-CoV-2 protein target(s), and Cefuroxime rank.\nFour studies (Al-Khafaji et al., 2020; Alméciga-Díaz et al., 2020; Jorge Galvez et al., 2020; Koulgi et al., 2020) reported Cefuroxime as a top-ranked inhibitor drug for Mpro. Galvez and colleagues (Jorge Galvez et al., 2020) employed a Molecular Topology (MT) methodology that has been successful in identifying drugs for cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, and Malaria (J. Galvez et al., 2012). The MT approach involves representing the structure, and by extension, the pharmacologic activity of drugs or molecules by a set of numbers called topological indices. Based on topological indices, drugs can be partitioned into groups that have similar mathematical patterns. A mathematical model or topological model is trained to learn a desired mathematical pattern. Once validated, the topological model can be used to search drug libraries to identify other drugs that have the desired mathematical pattern, hence, the desired pharmacologic activity (J. Galvez et al., 2012; Jorge Galvez et al., 2020). Galvez and colleagues took Lopinavir, the HIV-1 protease that was predicted in some studies to have activity against Mpro, as a gold standard drug. Using the MT approach, they screened about 15,000 molecules from 2 drug libraries and identified 22 other drugs, including Cefuroxime, that are predicted to bind tighter than Lopinavir. The predicted inhibitory potency of these drugs was expressed by an arbitrary index. Lopinavir had an index score of 2.9 while Cefuroxime had an index score of 3.9.\nAlmeciga-Diaz and colleagues (Alméciga-Díaz et al., 2020) used a proprietary algorithm (Alméciga-Diaz et al., 2019) to screen a subset of ZINC library for drugs that could bind to the active cavity of Mpro. Prior to screening, they demonstrated that their algorithm correctly predicted the binding of a number of inhibitor molecules that have been reported for Mpro, including N3 and α-ketonamide-based inhibitors. They observed a very strong correlation (R2 = 0.89) between the binding energy and reported IC50of these inhibitors. Consequently, they predicted IC50 based on binding energy. From screening of over 11,000 drugs, they identified 10 potential inhibitor drugs, including Cefuroxime, that had smaller binding energy than the previously reported inhibitors. Cefuroxime ranked 8th and was predicted to bind with affinity energy of -9.2 kcal/mol with an IC50 of 2.09 µM. The top-ranked drug had an affinity energy of -9.8 kcal/mol and an IC50 of 1.84 µM.\nKoulgi and colleagues (Koulgi et al., 2020) using both a “direct docking” and an “ensemble docking” approach. The direct docking was a straightforward docking of potential drugs against the crystal structure of Mpro while the ensemble approach involved docking against variations in conformation of the active site of Mpro, which usually leads to better results. To achieve the ensemble approach, they performed molecular dynamic simulation (MDS) via Root mean Square Deviation (RMSD) based clustering and Markov State Modeling analysis to obtain 16 conformations of Mpro. Grid scores for drugs in two drug libraries, one of which was the official FDA approved drug list, were reported for both approaches. Expectedly, the ensemble approach produced better docking scores. Cefuroxime, via trade name of Ceftin, was identified as the second-best drug from the FDA drug library via the ensemble approach with a grid score of -49.33. This score was better than a score of -46.05 for the best ranked drug from the direct docking approach.\nAl-Khafaji and colleagues (Al-Khafaji et al., 2020) employed covalent docking screening to identify potential drugs that could bind covalently, hence irreversibly, to Cys145 of the active site of Mpro. Cys145 of Mpro has been identified as a vital residue that can be covalently bound by drugs to inhibit activity of Mpro (Dai et al., 2020; Xue et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2020). To this end, they obtained the crystal structures of 48 pre-screened FDA-approved drugs and antiviral agents, including Cefuroxime, that are known to bind covalently to targets. The drugs were ranked by their binding energies that was determined using Prime MM-GBSA (Genheden & Ryde, 2015). They concluded that the top 8 drugs showed a higher affinity to form covalent, irreversible bond with Cys145 of the active site of Mpro. Cefuroxime was the 5th highest ranking <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightgreen; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">drug<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">usages</span>\n</mark> with a binding energy of -54.25 kcal/mol while <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightorange; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">Remdesivir<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">chemical</span>\n</mark> ranked third with a binding energy of -65.19 kcal/mol.\nWu et. al (Wu et al., 2020) was one of the earliest and one of the most cited paper on in silico experiments for SARS-CoV-2 as at the time of writing this paper. The authors screened FDA-approved drugs from ZINC database, and a database of known antiviral agents against active sites all SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Drug candidates were scored based on the well established Internal Coordinate Mechanics (ICM) (Abagyan et al., 1994). The binding energies of potential drug candidates were expressed as ICM scores and ICM mfscores (mean force scores). The ICM score is a measure of the overall empirical function of the predicted physical interaction while the ICM mfscore is an independent score of the strength of drug-receptor interaction (Abagyan et al., 2020; Muegge & Martin, 1999; Neves et al., 2012). Per the ICM user guide, the score is considered the best scoring to use for docking result analysis, and ICM scores less than -32 are generally considered to be good scores. (Abagyan et al., 2020). Wu and colleagues considered drug candidates with ICM scores less than -30 or ICM mfscores less than -110 to have potential activity against targeted proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Cefuroxime was among top-ranked drugs was predicted to inhibit RdRp. From the ICM score data provided in supplementary files, against Rdrp, Cefuroxime had an ICM score of -41.30, which was the highest, and mfscore of -63.04. <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightorange; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">Remdesivir<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">chemical</span>\n</mark> had a score of -27.4 and a mfscore of -113.\nAlthough excluded for not meeting eligibility criteria, we report a study (Elfiky, 2020) that also reported potential binding of Cefuroxime to RdRp. The author conducted MDS with molecular docking to investigate the binding of a handful of pre-selected drugs including antiviral agents and Cefuroxime to RdRp. The average binding energy for Cefuroxime at -6.875 kcal/mol was within the margin of error of <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightorange; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">Remdesivir<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">chemical</span>\n</mark> at -7.16 kcal/mol.\nDar’ya and colleagues (Dar’ya et al., 2020) predicted that Cefuroxime may inhibit the ACE2-Spike complex. First, they created a resource called PolypharmDB that contained the predicted binding profiles of over 10,000 approved and experimental drugs. The resource was built using a proprietary tool, MatchMaker, that uses artificial intelligence via deep learning to predict the binding of drugs to about 8700 human and viral proteins. PolypharmDB was then queried for potential drugs that could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 proteins of interest, which revealed Cefuroxime as a top 5 drugs that may inhibit ACE2-Spike protein complex.\nCOVID-19 pandemic is a major public health threat that requires immediate action. Despite the intense efforts to develop novel drugs for SARS-CoV2, this process is time consuming with limited progress to date. Therefore, drug repurposing has been identified as the fastest way of realizing therapeutic agents for COVID-19 to meet the urgency of the situation.\nThere has been anecdotal evidence suggesting various drugs may be effective against SARS-CoV-2. Prospective studies investigating initially touted agents such as Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin have failed to show whether Hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with Azithromycin can effectively alter the disease course in patients with severe COVID-19 (Taccone et al., 2020). However, preliminary data analysis from a National Institutes of Health (NIH) sponsored randomized clinical <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightpink; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">trial<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">trials</span>\n</mark> (RCT) for <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightorange; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">Remdesivir<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">chemical</span>\n</mark> involving patients with advanced COVID-19 suggested that patients who <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightgreen; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">received<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">usages</span>\n</mark>  <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightorange; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">Remdesivir<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">chemical</span>\n</mark> had a significant 4-day difference in median time to recovery compared to those who received placebo (National Institutes of Health, 2020).

Despite this early success, many unanswered questions remain about <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightorange; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">Remdesivir<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">chemical</span>\n</mark> including its availability, route of administration (exists only in intravenous form), cost, and indication for use in non-severe hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients. For these reasons, additional therapeutic agents are needed in the fight against SARS-CoV-2.\nIn this study, we set out to determine if there was a molecular basis for possible activity of Cefuroxime against SARS-CoV-2 by conducting a scoping review of literature of in silico drug-repurposing experiments against SARS-CoV-2. We identified 6 original articles from 4 continents that, from a large library of existing drugs, reported Cefuroxime as a top-ranked potential inhibitor of 3 key SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Four studies reported that Cefuroxime may inhibit Mpro, one study reported Cefuroxime may inhibit RdRp, while another reported Cefuroxime may inhibit the ACE2-Spike protein binding complex. These findings suggest that there is an in silico basis to assume Cefuroxime may be active against SARS-CoV-2. Although not previously known to have anti-viral activity (GlaxoSmithKline, 2019), given the reported strong binding to 3 SARS-CoV-2 proteins in silico, Cefuroxime may be a multi-target inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2. Multi-target agents carry the prospect of being more robust and more likely to live up to expectations as they tend to be less affected by individual differences in response, modifications in key disease- relevant biological pathways, and the activation of compensatory mechanism (Talevi, 2015; Xie et al., 2012; Zimmermann et al., 2007).\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first review to suggest Cefuroxime as a possible “weapon” in the fight against SARS-CoV-2. However, the clinical usefulness of Cefuroxime for COVID-19 will depend on its clinical efficacy and safety profile. To determine clinical efficacy, phase II/III clinical trials are needed. Regarding safety, Cefuroxime has a good profile. The most common adverse drugs reactions are gastrointestinal effects; nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, and these effects are dose dependent, occurring with higher doses and longer duration of use (Emmerson, 1988; Henry et al., 1995). In one large study, gastrointestinal adverse effects were seen in less than 5% of patients with only 2.2% discontinuing use predominantly due to gastrointestinal side effects (Perry & Brogden, 1996). Consequently, one concern that may arise with its use for COVID-19 is the possibility of exacerbation of gastrointestinal symptoms of COVID-19. A systematic review/meta-analysis of 60 studies of gastrointestinal symptoms of COVID-19 reported a pooled prevalence of 17.6% with higher prevalence (17.1%) in patients with severe disease than patients with non-severe disease (11.8%). The most commonly reported symptoms were anorexia (26.8%), diarrhea (12.5%), nausea and vomiting (10.2%), and abdominal pain (9.2%). (Cheung et al., 2020). Therefore, if Cefuroxime were prescribed for COVID-19, worsening gastrointestinal symptoms would suggest either disease progression or adverse drug effects, the two of which can be distinguished by presence of symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, loss of smell, loss of taste, which are seen with COVID-19 but not with Cefuroxime. Other adverse effects of Cefuroxime occur less commonly and have been estimated to occur in between 0.1% to 1% of subjects over several multiple-dose trials (GlaxoSmithKline, 2019).\nBesides the possibility of being an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2, there may be additional benefit to using Cefuroxime for COVID-19. Though actual numbers may vary, it is not uncommon for patients with COVID-19 to have suspected or confirmed bacterial super-infection or co-infection requiring antibiotic coverage. A single site study (Zhou et al., 2020) from China reported 15% prevalence of secondary bacterial infection among hospitalized patients while a rapid review of literature of bacterial and fungal co-infection among COVID-19 patients (Rawson et al., 2020) reported 8% bacterial/fungal co-infection. Nevertheless, up to 70% of hospitalized patients received empiric antibiotics for suspected bacterial infection (Cox et al., 2020; Rawson et al., 2020). Since Cefuroxime is a broad spectrum antibiotic with excellent activity against many respiratory pathogens, it is reasonable to consider it as an option for empiric therapy in suspected cases of bacterial super-infection/co-infection, particularly for patients with mild disease (non-hospitalized patients or hospitalized patients without respiratory compromise), pending the isolation of a specific pathogen. Patients with moderate-to-severe disease with suspicion of bacterial super-infection will likely benefit from broader empiric coverage than offered by Cefuroxime as they are at a higher risk of mortality (Lippi & Plebani, 2020; Zhou et al., 2020).\nThere are certain limitations in our scoping review that should be acknowledged. First, there was significant heterogeneity among the studies we reviewed, especially with regards the methodology. While this can be regarded as a strength, this also hints at need for reproducibility. Second, only studies that reported Cefuroxime as a top-ranked drug were included in this study. There are many other studies that did not identify Cefuroxime as a top-ranked drug. Consequently, it is unclear if the 6 studies included in this review represent a significant finding in the larger body of literature on in silico drug repurposing for COVID-19. An early systematic review of in silico drug repurposing for COIVD-19 identified 21 studies (Mohamed et al., 2020), which included one paper in this study. Since then, several studies have been published. Consequently, new systematic reviews are needed to evaluate the significance of our findings. Third, this was a review of in silico studies. Further in vitro and in vivo studies are required to determine the efficacy of Cefuroxime and its potential as a therapeutic agent against SARS-CoV-2.\nCOVID-19 is a significant public health emergency that carries a pressing demand for an effective therapeutic. Due to the urgency of this health crisis, drug repurposing is the most efficient method of meeting this need. Successful interventions may require action on multiple targets of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The second-generation cephalosporin Cefuroxime demonstrates potential activity against three SARS-CoV-2 proteins in in silico experiments and may be a promising multi-target inhibitor. Cefuroxime’s long history of population monitoring makes it a reliable option for further in vitro and in vivo studies in the fight against COVID-19.</br></br>UNKNOWN URL AND TITLE</br></br>The unpredictable emergence of new infectious diseases can be seen as a threat to human health and global stability, despite extraordinary progress in development of countermeasures such as diagnostics, vaccines, and treatments. Diseases caused by coronaviruses are a few of many examples of emerging infectious diseases in the modern world (Morens and Fauci, 2013). Coronaviruses (CoVs) are emerging and re-emerging pathogens and several of them have caused serious problems in humans and animals (Lau and Chan, 2015). These include varying symptoms ranging from mild respiratory illness to severe infections causing death. Apart from the respiratory tract, coronaviruses can also affect other organs in the body, such as the gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidney, and brain of both humans and animals. The pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002–2003, the emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012 and the emergence of a new coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causal agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, are all examples of human infections leading to significant fatality caused by coronaviruses (Anindita et al., 2015; Guarner, 2020; WHO, 2020).\nNotably, the key features of the SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are all similar in that they exhibit dominance of hospital-acquired infection, and pathogenesis driven by a combination of viral replication in the lower respiratory tract and an aberrant host immune response (de Wit et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2020a). In the laboratory, general recommended precautions for handling the highly pathogenic human coronaviruses include biosafety level 2 (BSL2) facilities for diagnosis and biosafety level 3 (BSL3) facilities for propagation (Artika and Ma'roef, 2017). However, in the situations when limited information is available on the newly emerged highly pathogenic coronaviruses, it is prudent to implement additional safeguards until more data are available for laboratory risk assessment (WHO, 2004; BMBL, 2009). In addition, it is important to note that although coronaviruses are enveloped viruses, this does not mean that they are necessarily fragile or quickly inactivated. Coronavirus particles are relatively robust compared to HIV-1. SARS-CoV particles for example, remain infectious for 1–4 days on the relatively harsh environment of hard surfaces. MERS-CoV virions are slightly more fragile than SARS-CoV, with half lives of approximately one hour on hard surfaces and a maximum survival time of 2–3 days. However, MERS-CoV virions are much more robust than the pandemic influenza A virus under the same conditions. The evidence of persistent infectivity of coronaviruses outside the body suggests that direct contact with contaminated surfaces and respiratory droplets is a likely route of MERS-CoV spread (Neuman and Buchmeier, 2016).\nPopulation shift from rural areas to urban areas, and the increasingly frequent mixing of different animal species in densely populated areas, have been thought to facilitate the emergence and re-emergence of some coronaviruses (Lau and Chan, 2015). Increased contact with wild life in developing regions, greater levels of international travel and trade, and different land use have also been found as contributing factors for the rapid emergence of pathogenic viruses (Rosenberg et al., 2013). The nature of viral genetic material has also been suggested to influence the propensity for emergence. About 85% of emerging viruses have single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) genomes, which are prone to uncorrected errors during replication (Rosenberg et al., 2013). In general, the rate of error during RNA replication (about 10−4) is greater than that of DNA (about10−5). In contrast to DNA polymerase, the RNA polymerase which catalyzes the replication of RNA molecule does not have the proofreading capabilities nor post-replication mismatch repair mechanisms. Consequently, the potential for mutation per replication cycle of an RNA genome is high (Rosenberg, 2015). Coronaviruses possess genomic material in the form of single-stranded RNA and have been found to have high mutation and recombination rates, which might allow them to cross species barriers and adapt to new hosts (Lau and Chan, 2015). Today, coronaviruses are known as one of the most rapidly evolving viruses due to their high genomic nucleotide substitution and recombination rates (Lim et al., 2016). SARS viruses, for example, have the capacity to be directly transmitted from animals to humans (Rosenberg, 2015). The evolution of coronaviruses is also a result of their interaction with their hosts. For example, it was reported that the host shift of SARSr-CoV mostly occurred in different species under the same genus Rhinolophus, indicating that genetic distance between hosts also determines both the host shift and the cross-species transmission of the viruses (Yu et al., 2019).\nSome Asian regions are considered as hot spots of viral disease emergence especially the areas of rapid social and environmental change (Horby et al., 2013). For example, the SARS-CoV emerged in Guangdong, China, and then spread to many countries in South East Asia, North America, Europe, and South Africa. Transmission from person to person occurred through droplets, personal contact, or by touching contaminated surfaces. Health professionals, in particular, were reported to be at a high risk of acquiring the disease, as transmission also occurred when isolation precautions were inadequate. The last case of SARS-CoV occurred in September 2003, after having infected over 8,096 persons in 11 countries and causing 774 deaths with a case fatality rate of 9.5% (Luk et al., 2019; Guarner, 2020). The SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19, emerged in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019. As of 12 August 2020, the virus has affected more than 200 countries around the world with human cases of more than 20,162,000 and of more than 737,000 deaths (WHO, 2020).\nChina, in particular, has been predicted by scientists as a region of high potential for pathogenic coronaviruses emergence. This prediction was made based on the association between coronavirus species, bat species, and geographical location in China which potentially lead to cross-species transmission of coronaviruses (Fan et al., 2019). Bats are now regarded as important reservoir hosts of coronaviruses. Prior to the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan in late 2019, two highly pathogenic coronaviruses of bat origin, the SARS-CoV and the swine-acute-diarrhea-syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) have emerged in China over the past two decades. They caused large-scale disease outbreaks in humans and pigs, respectively. Apart from being the most populous nation in the world, China is the third largest territory with great biodiversity including bats and bat-borne viruses. The majority of the currently identified coronaviruses can be found in China. Moreover, most of the bat hosts of these coronaviruses live in close proximity to humans. According to Chinese food culture, freshly slaughtered animals are more nutritious. This may increase the potential of coronavirus transmission to humans. In particular, the bat SARS related coronaviruses capable of using the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor are considered to pose a direct threat to humans. Astonishingly, all of the SARS related coronaviruses which are capable of using human ACE2 are found China. Therefore, it is generally believed that bat-borne coronaviruses will re-emerge to cause future disease outbreaks and China is a likely hotspot (Fan et al., 2019).\nThe Southeast Asian region is also considered to be susceptible to coronavirus emergence. For instance, from 1 March 2003 to 11 May 2003, a SARS outbreak occurred in Singapore and a total of 206 probable SARS cases were diagnosed. The outbreak was the most severe infectious disease to challenge the public health system of Singapore (Tan, 2006). MERS-CoV infections linked to travel in the Middle East were reported to occur in Malaysia and the Philippines. In addition, a MERS-CoV infection associated to visiting Thailand was also detected in an Omani citizen (Setianingsih et al., 2019). In Indonesia, infection by human coronavirus 229E was detected in samples from 1 out of 13 hospitalized patients suspected of MERS-CoV infection who were admitted to an infectious disease hospital in Jakarta from July 2015 to December 2016 (Setianingsih et al., 2019). Infections of human coronaviruses NL63 and 229E have also been reported in Malaysia. The SARS-CoV-2, which emerged in Wuhan, has also been identified in many Southeast Asian countries including Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, Viet Nam, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, and Timor-Leste (WHO, 2020). In addition, bats harboring coronaviruses have been discovered in the Philippines, Thailand and Indonesia (Anindita et al., 2015). Avian coronavirus, the main representative of the genus Gammacoronavirus, has recently been isolated from the Eclectus parrot (Eclectus roratus) in Indonesia (Suryaman et al., 2019).\nCross-species transmission has been known to play an important role in the emergence of viral diseases. For example, viruses from wildlife hosts have caused high-impact diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Ebola fever, and influenza in humans. The emergence of many human diseases has occurred when established animal viruses switch hosts into humans and then are transmitted within human populations (Parrish et al., 2008). In general, there are at least four major criteria which determine the successful cross-species transmission of a particular virus: the availability of susceptible host cells which have the specific receptor required for viral entry; permissiveness of these host cells to permit the virus to replicate and complete their replication cycle; accessibility of susceptible and permissive cells in the host; and the inability of the host cells’ innate immune response to restrict the viral replication (Hulswit et al., 2016). Most of the emerging viruses are zoonotic, in that, they can be transmitted from animals to humans (Morens and Fauci, 2013). Biological, ecological and epidemiological factors have been suggested to determine the successful cross-species transmission. The high frequency with which RNA viruses jump species boundaries in part reflects their ability to rapidly generate important adaptive variation. As RNA viruses, coronaviruses seem to exhibit a strong zoonotic potential (Leopardi et al., 2018). Host switching has been shown to contribute to coronavirus evolution and the diversity of coronaviruses may be associated with the potential risk of zoonotic emergence (Anthony et al., 2017).\nAlthough the majority of individual virus species seems to be restricted to a narrow host range of a single animal species, genome sequencing and phylogenetic analyses indicate that coronaviruses have often crossed the host-species barrier. Bats harbor great coronavirus genetic diversity. The majority, if not all of coronaviruses which infect humans are believed to originate from bat coronaviruses which are transmitted to humans directly or indirectly through an intermediate host (Hu et al., 2015; Hulswit et al., 2016). The emergence of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 underpin the threat of cross-species transmission events resulting in outbreaks in humans (Menachery et al., 2015; Lu et al., 2020). Prior to the outbreak of SARS-CoV in 2002–2003, only two human coronaviruses, the HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E, were known. They were identified in the 1960s. The emergence of SARS-CoVs sparked the search for novel coronaviruses and led to the identification of HCoV-NL63 in 2004 and HCoV-HKU1 in 2005. The common human CoVs are generally not considered to be highly pathogenic and are associated with relatively mild clinical symptoms in immunocompetent individuals and cause a self-limiting upper respiratory tract disease. In some cases, they may also cause a more severe infection in the lower respiratory tract. It is reported that young, elderly, and immunocompromised individuals are the most susceptible to the coronavirus infections (McBride and Fielding, 2012; Enjuanes et al., 2016). A list of important human pathogenic coronaviruses is presented in Table 1\n(Lim et al., 2016; Cui et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2020; WHO, 2020; Yee et al., 2020).\nThe SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the SARS-CoV-2 are three highly transmissible pathogens that emerged in human over the past 2 decades (Cui et al., 2019; Andersen et al., 2020). In the case of SARS-CoV, it is most likely that the virus originated from bats through sequential recombination of bat SARS related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs) and that masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) were intermediate hosts. It is thought that recombination occurred in bats before SARS-CoV was introduced into Guangdong Province through infected civets or other infected mammals from Yunnan (Cui et al., 2019). Epidemiological studies indicated that civets from live animal markets in Guangdong Province, China, played an important role for human exposure to SARS-CoV. However, most of the masked palm civets from the wild, or from farms, were negative for SARS-CoV, indicating that those palm civets were not a reservoir, but intermediate hosts for the SARS-CoV (Su et al., 2016). Subsequent investigations have found that wild horseshoe bats (Rhinolophidae family), which are also present in live animal markets in China, have detectable levels of antibodies against SARS-CoV and also a SARS-CoV-like virus, suggesting that SARS-CoV originated in bats. An evolutionary hypothesis was then proposed that the ancestor for SARS-CoV first spread to bats of the Hipposideridae family, then bats of the Rhinolophidae family, then to masked palm civets and eventually humans (Su et al., 2016). Following studies suggested that Chinese horseshoe bats are the natural reservoirs of SARS-CoV and intermediate hosts might not be needed for direct human infection (Su et al., 2016). Similarly, recent molecular epidemiological studies involving 339 SARS-CoV and SARSr-CoV genome sequences including 274 from human and 18 from civets (collected in 2003/2004) and 47 from bats (continuously isolated for the past 13 years after the SARS epidemic) concluded that the human SARS-CoV was a result of multiple recombination events from a number of SARSr-CoV ancestors in different horseshoe bats species (Luk et al., 2019).\nSimilarly, MERS-CoV is also believed to have originated in bats. While palm civets have been linked to the emergence of SARS, dromedary camels were suggested to play roles as intermediate host for the emergence of MERS-CoV. The majority of the MERS index cases were reported to have contact with camels. Moreover, MERS-CoV strains isolated from camels were almost identical to those isolated from humans (Cui et al., 2019). As some confirmed cases lacked a contact history with camels, it has been suggested that there has been direct human-to-human MERS-CoV transmission, or through contact with a yet-to-be-identified animal species which maintained as a reservoir of MERS-CoV. Furthermore, studies on HKU4, a coronavirus of bat origin and the most phylogenically closely related to MERS-CoV, showed that HKU4 has the ability to utilize the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) receptor for virus entry. As DPP4 is a known receptor for MERS-CoV, the similarity in receptor specificity of these two CoVs supports the hypothesis that MERS-CoVs is of bat-origin. However, live MERS-CoV has yet to be isolated from wild bats (Su et al., 2016).\nIn the case of SARS-CoV-2, a number of studies have been carried out in order to investigate the original host of the virus. Again, bats have been suggested as likely reservoir hosts (Lu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) and pangolins have been suggested as a possible hosts in the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 (Lam et al., 2020). Although bats are the likely reservoir hosts for this virus, their general ecological separation from humans implies that other mammalian species may act as ‘‘intermediate’’ or ‘‘amplifying’’ hosts (Zhang and Holmes, 2020). In addition, the possibility that the virus originated from a laboratory has also been critically analyzed (Andersen et al., 2020). As the virus is newly discovered, currently, the spectrum of available diagnostic tools is tight. More studies are needed to elucidate its origin, tropism, and pathogenesis (Phan, 2020). Further discussion on molecular characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 is presented in Section 4.\nOne of the important factors linked to the ability of viruses to cross the species barrier is the accumulation of mutations in their genomes (Djikeng and Spiro, 2009). Cross-species transmission may also be facilitated by homologous recombination events which radically alter or cause deletions in viral RNA genomes (Rowe et al., 1997; Ji et al., 2020). For the SARS-CoVs, comparison of genome sequences of the viruses from market civets and humans revealed that they are almost identical. However, two genes, the S and ORF8, were found to show major variation. Two amino acid residues (479 and 487) in the receptor binding domain of the S gene were found to be important for ACE2 receptor-mediated infection of the SARS-CoV and for the virus transmission from civets to humans (Cui et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2019). In addition, the ORF8 protein was indicated to be important for interspecies transmission, as most human SARS-CoV epidemic strains harbor a signature 29-nucleotide deletion in ORF8 compared to civet SARSr-CoVs. The deletion leads to generation of two different open reading frames, ORF 8a and 8b (Fan et al., 2019). Comparison of full-length genomic sequences of MERS-CoVs isolated from humans and camels also showed that the two genomes are almost identical. Variations were found in S, ORF4b, and ORF3 genes. Notably, although several amino acid substitutions were observed in the S protein, none of them was located in the receptor binding domain (Cui et al., 2019).\nAs constant cross-species transmission of coronaviruses from animal hosts to human occurs, and this is mainly due to human activities, such as modern agricultural practices, frequent interactions of wild animals with humans and urbanization, it is therefore of great importance to maintain the barrier between natural reservoirs and human society in order to effectively prevent viral zoonosis (Cui et al., 2019; Phan, 2020). In addition, comprehensive studies of bat-borne coronaviruses are critical for mitigating, predicting, and preventing future zoonotic coronavirus outbreaks (Hu et al., 2015). Although it has become increasingly clear that bats are important reservoirs of coronaviruses, currently only 6% of all coronavirus sequences in GenBank are from bats. The rest 94% pimarily consist of known pathogens of public health or agricultural significance, which indicates that current studies are heavily biased towards describing known diseases rather than the ‘pre-emergent’ potential pool in bats (Anthony et al., 2017).\nCoronaviruses are members of family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales. These enveloped viruses possess genomes in the form of single-stranded RNA molecules of positive sense, that is, the same sense as the messenger RNA (mRNA). At present, four genera are known: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus. Members of the genera Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus are identified to cause human disease, whereas those of the genera Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus are causative agents of animal disease (Masters, 2006; Anindita et al., 2015).\nCoronaviruses have a typical characteristic in negative-stained electron microscopy showing a fringe on their surface structure like a spike. This fringe resembles the solar corona, from which the name coronavirus was derived (Masters, 2006). These viruses are roughly spherical with average diameter of 80–120 nm. The surface spikes of the coronaviruses projects about 17–20 nm from the surface of the virus particle and have been described as club-like, pear-shaped, or petal-shaped, having a thin base which swells to a width of approximately 10 nm at the distal extremity (Masters, 2006). A schematic visualization of the coronavirus virion is presented in Figure 1\n. In infection, the coronavirus particle serves three important functions for the genome: First, it provides the means to deliver the viral genome across the plasma membrane of a host cell; second, it serves as a means of escape for the newly synthesized genome; third, the viral particle functions as a durable vessel which protects the genome integrity on its journey between cells (Neuman and Buchmeier, 2016).\nInvestigation of the internal component of the coronavirus conducted using virions which have burst spontaneously and expelled their content, or using virions which have been treated using detergents, showed that the viruses possess helically symmetric nucleocapsids. Of note, such nucleocapsid symmetry is generally formed by viruses having negative-strand RNA. To the contrary, almost all animal viruses with positive-strand RNA have icosahedral ribonucleoprotein capsids. Although it is generally accepted that coronaviruses have helical nucleocapsids of 14–16 nm in diameter, other studies employing different virus species and methods of preparation, have reported different results such as filamentous structures of 9–11 nm or 11–13 nm in diameter, or a linear strand of 6–7 μm long which may represent unwound helices, etc (Masters, 2006). More recent studies using cryo-electron microscopy to investigate the structural organization of SARS-CoV showed that the ribonucleoprotein particles form a coiled shape, packaged in spherical form with no indication of icosahedral symmetry (Chang et al., 2014). Electron microscopic studies of ribonucleoprotein of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), also a betacoronavirus, showed that the ribonucleoproteins are in either a loose filamentous structure or in a compact flower-like assembly (Gui et al., 2017).\nThe genome of the coronaviruses codes four main structural proteins: the spike (S) protein, the nucleocapsid (N) protein, the membrane (M) protein and the envelope (E) protein, each of which play primary roles in the structure of the virus particle as well as in other aspects of the viral replication cycle. Generally, all of these proteins are needed to form a structurally complete virion. Some coronaviruses, however, do not require the full assemblage of the structural proteins to produce a complete, infectious viral particle. This indicates that some structural proteins are likely dispensable, or that those viruses may encode additional proteins with compensatory roles (Schoeman and Fielding, 2019). The envelope of coronaviruses contains three or four viral proteins. The major proteins of the viral envelope are the S and the M proteins. In some, but not all coronaviruses, a third major envelope protein, the hemagglutinin esterase (HE) is found. Lastly, the small E protein constitutes a minor however critical structural component of the viral envelope (de Haan et al., 1999). Many of the coronavirus proteins are modified by post-translational modifications which change the protein structure by proteolytic cleavage and disulfide bond formation or extend the chemical repertoire of the 20 standard amino acids by introducing new functional groups. Functional groups are commonly added through phosphorylation, glycosylation and lipidation (such as palmitoylation and myristoylation). The post-translational modifications play critical roles in regulating folding, stability, enzymatic activity, subcellular localization and interaction of the viral protein with other proteins (Fung and Liu, 2018).\nIn contrast to the other main structural proteins, the N protein is the only protein which mainly plays roles to bind to the viral RNA genome to form the nucleoprotein. However, apart from its primarily function in packaging and stabilizing the viral genome, the N protein also plays roles in other aspects of the coronavirus replication cycle and in the modulation of host cellular response to viral infection such as regulating the host cell cycle, affecting cell stress response, influencing the immune system, etc. Although the N protein is not required for the viral envelope formation, it may be required for the whole virion formation as transient expression of gene encoding the N protein significantly increases the production of virus like particles in some coronaviruses (Schoeman and Fielding, 2019). The coronavirus has a large sized genome, while the overall size of the viral particle is similar to that of other RNA viruses. It seems therefore that the space inside the coronavirus envelope would not be adequate to encapsulate loosely packed ribonucleoproteins. Surprisingly, the way the coronaviruses package their large genome is similar to that of the eukaryotic cells, that is in the form of a supercoiled dense structure (Gui et al., 2017). The incorporation of the coronavirus genomic RNA into a virion is dependent on the N proteins. Recent studies using mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-infected cells showed that the cytoplasmic N proteins constitutively form oligomers through a process which does not need binding to genomic RNA. It was hypothesized that constitutive N protein oligomerization allows the optimal loading of the genomic viral RNA into a ribonucleoprotein complex through the presentation of multiple viral RNA binding motifs (Cong et al., 2017).\nThe coronavirus spike (S) protein is a large glycosylated transmembrane protein ranging from about 1162 to 1452 amino acid residues. Monomers of the S protein, prior to glycosylation, are 128–160 kDa, but molecular masses of the glycosylated forms of the full-length monomer are 150–200 kDa. Following translation, the proteins fold into a metastable prefusion form and assemble into a homotrimer forming the coronavirus distinctive surface spike of crown-like appearance. The S protein is the most outward envelope protein of the coronaviruses. The S glycoprotein plays critical roles in mediating virus attachment to the host cell receptors and facilitating fusion between viral and host cell membranes. In addition, it is the primary determinant of the coronavirus tropism. Changes in the S protein especially in the regions involved in the interactions with entry receptors, may result in altered host, tissue, or cellular tropism of the coronaviruses (Masters, 2006; Hulswit et al., 2016). The S protein is the main antigen present at the surface of the coronaviruses functioning as a major inducer of host immune responses. During infection, the S protein is the target of the neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, it has been a focus in vaccine design (Li, 2016; Tortorici et al., 2019).\nThe S protein is inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum through a cleaved, amino-terminal signal peptide. The domain that extends into the outside space of the virus (virion exterior), termed ectodomain, makes up most of the molecule, with only a small N-terminal segment (of 71 residues or fewer) constituting the transmembrane domain and endodomain. The endodomain also called intracellular tail (IC) is located in the inside space of the virus (virion interior) (Masters, 2006; Li, 2016). The multifunctional S protein can be divided into two functionally distinct subunits: the S1 and S2 subunits (Figure 2\na). The global S1 subunit is critical for receptor recognition, while S2 subunit is important for membrane fusion and for anchoring the S protein into the viral membrane (Hulswit et al., 2016; Tortorici et al., 2019). The S1 subunit consists of two major domains which fold independently, the N-terminal domain (S1-NTD) and the C-terminal domain (S1-CTD). Depending on the virus, one or both of these domains may bind to receptors and function as a receptor-binding domain (RBD). While the RBD of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is at the S1-NTD, the majority of other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have the RBDs at the S1-CTDs. The S1-NTDs are responsible for binding sugar receptor molecules except for the betacoronavirus MHV, the S1-NTD of which binds a protein receptor CEACAM1. The roles of the S1-CTDs are to bind to protein receptors ACE2, APN, and DPP4 (Li, 2016; Ou et al., 2020). Structurally, the S1 subunit of the betacoronavirus S protein is divided into 4 distinct β-rich domains, A, B, C, and D. Domains A and B are suggested to serve as RBD. The core structure of domain A shows a galectin-like β-sandwich fold. The domain B contains a core subdomain of antiparallel β-sheets decorated with an extended loop on the viral membrane-distal side. The domains A and B are linked by a linker region. The domain A is located within the functionally S1-NTD, whereas the domains B, C, and D are located within the S1-CTD. The domains C and D form β-sheet-rich structures adjacent to the S2 subunit (Hulswit et al., 2016). Structural studies of SARS-CoV RBD revealed that the RBD contains a core and a motif termed receptor-binding motif (RBM) which is critical for forming contact with receptor (Shang et al., 2020).\nThe S2 subunit of coronaviruses is highly conserved and contains segments which have critical roles to facilitate virus-cell fusion. These segments include the fusion peptide (FP), two heptad repeat regions, the heptad repeat region 1 (HR1 or HR-N), heptad repeat region 2 (HR2 or HR-C) and the highly conserved transmembrane domain (Figure 2b). The HR-2 region locates close to the C-terminal end of the S ectodomain. In the prefusion conformation of the MHV and HKU1 S proteins, the S2 subunit consists of segments of multiple α-helices and a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet at the viral membrane-proximal end. The fusion peptide forms a short helix of which the conserved hydrophobic residues are buried in an interface with other elements of S2. The conserved fusion peptide is not directly upstream of the HR1 but located about 65 residues upstream HR1. Another fusion peptide (termed FP2) has also been suggested to be exist immediately upstream of the HR1 region. The metastable prefusion structure of the S2 subunit has been suggested to be locked by a cap formed by intertwined S1 protomers (Hulswit et al., 2016; Li, 2016).\nFollowing its synthesis, the coronavirus S protein undergoes post-translational modifications which include glycosylation, disulfide bond formation and palmitoylation. The virion exterior (luminal) ectodomain of the S protein is highly glycosylated and this modification is exclusively N-linked. The S protein ectodomains have from 19 to 39 potential consensus glycosylation sites. For the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) S protein, it has been shown that the initial steps of glycosylation occur cotranslationally, but that terminal glycosylation is preceded by trimerization, which may be rate limiting in the S protein maturation. The N-linked glycosylation has been indicated to contribute significantly to the conformation of coronavirus S protein, and therefore undoubtedly affects the receptor binding and antigenicity of S protein. The glycosylation of TGEV S protein, for instance, was suggested to assist monomer folding, given that tunicamycin, a N-glycosylation inhibitor, was found to block trimerization. Notably, not all of the putative glycosylation sites are functional. For example, among the 23 putative glycosylation sites in the SARS-CoV S protein, only 12 sites were really glycosylated (Masters, 2006; Fung and Liu, 2018). In addition, the S protein ectodomain has between 30 and 50 cysteine residues, and within each coronavirus group the position of cysteine residues is well conserved. It has been reported that disulfide bond formation occurs in S proteins of MHV, suggesting that the disulfide bonds are essential for the correct folding, trafficking and trimerization of the S proteins (Masters, 2006; Fung and Liu, 2018). The conserved cysteine residues in the endodomain tail of the S proteins are modified by palmitoylation which in some coronaviruses have been suggested to be important for the S protein trafficking and folding, virion assembly and infectivity, as well as for the interaction between S and M proteins (Fung and Liu, 2018).\nIn most coronaviruses, the S protein is cleaved by a trypsin-like host protease into two polypeptides, S1 and S2, of approximately the same size which are still covalently bound in the prefusion conformation. Even for uncleaved proteins, that is, such as the SARS-CoV, the designation of S1 and S2 is used for the N-terminal and C-terminal halves of the S protein respectively. Peptide sequencing has demonstrated that cleavage takes place following the last residue in a highly basic motif of the S protein: RRFRR in infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV), RRAHR in MHV strain A59, and KRRSRR in bovine coronavirus (BCoV). Similar cleavage sites are predicted from some others S protein, except that of SARS-CoV. During viral entry, the S2 subunit is further proteolytically cleaved at the S2’ site, upstream of the fusion protein (Masters, 2006; Tortorici et al., 2019). The S1 subunit is the most divergent region of the S protein, both across and within the three coronavirus groups. Even among strains and isolates of a single coronavirus species, the sequence of S1 can vary considerably. To the contrary, the most conserved part of the molecule across the three coronavirus groups is the region that encompasses S2 portion of the ectodomain, plus the start of the transmembrane domain (Masters, 2006). It has been hypothesized that the S1 domains of the S protein oligomer constitute the bulb portion of the spike. The stalk portion of the spike, on the other hand, was envisioned to be a coiled-coil-structure, formed by association of heptad repeat regions of the S2 domains of monomers (Masters, 2006).\nThe membrane (M) glycoprotein is the most abundant envelope protein of coronaviruses playing critical roles in the virion assembly through M-M, M-spike (S), and M-nucleocapsid (N) protein interactions (Arndt et al., 2010). Generally, its length is 217–230 amino acids. It is a triple-spanning membrane protein with a short amino-terminal domain located on the exodomain of the virus (in the virion exterior, equivalent to the lumen of intracellular organelles) and a long carboxy-terminal domain in the endodomain of the virion (in the virion interior, equivalent to the cytoplasmic space of intracellular membranes) (de Haan et al., 1999; Masters, 2006; Perrier et al., 2019). The nascent polypeptides, in the preglycosylated forms, are of 25–30 kDa (221–262 amino acids) and the detected glycosylated forms are of higher molecular weights (Masters, 2006). The C-terminal domains of the MERS-CoV and IBV M proteins have been shown to contain signals for the trans-Golgi network and the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC)/cis-Golgi localization, of host cells respectively (Perrier et al., 2019).\nThe M proteins from different coronaviruses show the same overall basic structure although their amino acid contents vary. The proteins have three transmembrane (TM) domains flanked by the amino terminal glycosylated domain and the carboxy-terminal domain. Multiple M domains and residues have been indicated to be essential for coronavirus assembly. After the third TM domain, the long intravirion (cytoplasmic) tail of M protein harbors an amphipathic domain and a short hydrophilic region at the carboxyl end of the tail. The amphipathic domain is suggested to be closely associated with the membrane. At the amino terminus of the amphipathic domain, there is a highly conserved 12-amino-acid domain with amino acid sequence SMWSFNPETNIL in the SARS-CoV M protein. This conserved domain (CD) has been suggested to be functionally important for M protein to participate in virus assembly (Arndt et al., 2010). The schematic domain and membrane topology of the M protein is shown in Figure 3\n.\nIt is proposed that lateral interactions between the coronavirus membrane proteins are important in mediating the formation of the virion envelope. This was based on the observation that when expressed alone, M protein accumulates in the Golgi complex of host cell in the form of homomultimeric complexes. However, when it is expressed in combination with the E protein, virus-like particles (VLPs) more or less of the authentic virion size and shape are assembled. This showed that the M and E proteins are the minimal requirements for envelope biogenesis. Furthermore, by employing the VLP assembly system it was suggested that all domains of the M protein are critical for virion assembly, and the interactions between membrane proteins (M-M interactions) play roles in promoting coronavirus envelope assembly (de Haan et al., 1999; Neuman et al., 2011).\nThe M protein is also important for the assembly of the S protein in the viral envelope. Heterotypic interactions between M protein and S protein have been indicated to be required for directing the incorporation of the S protein into the viral envelope in spite of the fact that the S protein is not essential for assembly of coronavirus particle. The S protein is incorporated into virions when present. When coronaviruses are grown in the presence of the N-glycosylation inhibitor, tunicamycin, virions are generated although without any spike (de Haan et al., 1999). The S protein is N-glycosylated and therefore is sensitive to tunicamycin (Mounir and Tablot, 1992). Glycosylation is believed to be important for ability of the virus to replicate in the host cells (Oostra et al., 2006). The interactions between M and S proteins have been demonstrated experimentally (de Haan et al., 1999).\nThe coronavirus M proteins also interact with each other. The M-M interactions constitute the overall scaffold for the viral envelope. In the mature virion, the S protein and a few of E molecules are interspersed in the M protein lattice (Arndt et al., 2010). The M protein was also shown to interact with the HE protein. The interaction was shown by cells infected with the bovine coronavirus expressing an HE protein, which generate complexes of the M, S, and HE proteins detected by co-immunoprecipitation assays. In addition, the M protein also interacts with the nucleocapsid during virus assembly (de Haan et al., 1999). The M protein is anchored by its three transmembrane domains to the viral envelope and by its carboxy-terminal tail interaction to the nucleocapsid (McBride et al., 2014). Recent studies indicated that the M protein of the HCoV-NL63 also plays roles during the early stages of infection by facilitating the viral attachment to the heparan sulfate proteoglycans used by the HCoV-NL63 as initial attachment factors (Naskalska et al., 2019).\nThe envelope (E) protein is a small integral membrane polypeptide, ranging from 76 to 109 amino acid residues with molecular weight of 8.4–12 kDa. The E protein plays important roles in a number of aspects of the coronavirus replication cycle, such as assembly, budding, envelope formation, and pathogenesis. Interestingly, although the protein is highly expressed inside the infected cells, only a small portion of the protein is incorporated into the viral envelope. Consequently, the protein is only a small constituent of the virus particle. Due to its small size and limited quantity, the E protein was identified much later compared to the other coronavirus structural proteins. Its primary and secondary structure indicates that the E protein has a short hydrophobic N terminus of 7–12 amino acid residues, followed by a transmembrane domain (TMD) of 25 amino acids, and ends with a long hydrophilic carboxy terminus (Masters, 2006; Schoeman and Fielding, 2019). The E protein harbors conserved cysteine residues in the hydrophilic region that are targets for palmitoylation. In addition, it contains conserved proline residues in the C-terminal tail (Figure 4\n) (Ruch and Machamer, 2012).\nThe hydrophobic region of the TMD is predicted to contain at least one α-helix which plays roles in the protein E oligomerization to form a membrane ion conductive pore termed viroporin. The amino acid sequence of the SARS-CoV E protein shows that a large portion of the TMD consists of the two non-polar amino acids, valine and leucine, which give the protein strong hydrophobicity. The overall net charge of the molecule is zero as the uncharged middle region is flanked by the negatively charged amino terminus and the variably charged carboxy terminus. The long C-terminus also shows some hydrophobicity due to the presence of a cluster of positively charged residues, however the hydrophobicity level is not as strong as that of the TMD. Interestingly, the C-terminus of the Beta- and Gamma-coronaviruses, has a conserved proline residue in the center of a β-coil-β motif. The motif has been suggested to serve as a Golgi-complex targeting signal, as mutation of the proline residue abolished the localization of the E protein in the host cells Golgi complex, and instead the mutant E protein then targeted the plasma membrane (Schoeman and Fielding, 2019).\nOne of the unique features of coronaviruses is the source of their membrane envelope. Differ from the other well-known enveloped viruses, coronaviruses bud into the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), from where they obtain their membrane envelope. Therefore, it is not surprising to find that most of the E protein is localized to the ERGIC and Golgi complex where the E protein plays roles in the assembly, budding and trafficking of the nascent virus particle (Schoeman and Fielding, 2019). Similar to the E protein, the S and M proteins are known to co-localize to the ERGIC. However, live-cell imaging studies of MHV E protein using confocal microscopy showed that, in contrast to the S and M proteins which are also localized in the plasma membrane, the E protein does not traffic to the surface of the cells, but remains at the site of viral assembly in the ERGIC. Furthermore, in the Golgi complex, the E protein is mainly concentrated in the cis and medial regions of this organelle. It should be noted that information regarding the precise cellular localization of the coronavirus E protein is critical in order to understand its roles in viral infection as to whether it is involved in morphogenesis or pathogenesis (Venkatagopalan et al., 2015).\nStudies of different coronaviruses have been conducted to determine the membrane topology of the E proteins and a variety of different E protein topologies have described and proposed (Schoeman and Fielding, 2019). Studies of the MHV E protein showed that the N-terminus of the protein is located in the lumen of the Golgi complex and the C-terminus is in the host cells cytoplasm (corresponds to the interior of the virus) (Venkatagopalan et al., 2015). Studies of SARS coronavirus E protein also suggested a topological conformation in which the E protein N-terminus is oriented towards the lumen of the intracellular membranes and the C-terminus faces the host cell's cytoplasm (Nieto-Torres et al., 2011). Similarly, experiments of IBV E protein showed that the N-terminus is located in the lumen of the Golgi complex and the C-terminus in the cytoplasm. On the contrary, the TGEV E protein shows a topology of a luminal C-terminus and a cytoplasmic N-terminus. FLAG-tagged SARS-CoV was reported to have an N- and C- terminus cytoplasmic topology. Prediction software has also been employed and resulted in conflicting predictions between both the software and the experimental data. A rationale for different membrane topologies has been proposed, in that, between the different coronavirus species, the E protein may not show a uniform topology depending on the level of protein expression and oligomerization. In addition, the membrane topology of the E protein might be dictated by its function, whether it is required to form viroporin or it is involved in the viral envelope during viral assembly (Schoeman and Fielding, 2019).\nIn several coronaviruses such as IBV, SARS-CoV, and MHV, the E protein is palmitoylated, i.e. it is modified by the addition of palmitic acid. The target amino acids for palmitoylation are the cysteine residues adjacent to the transmembrane domain. Palmitoylation has been suggested to plays roles in the subcellular protein trafficking as well as modulation of protein-protein interaction. Palmitoylation increases protein hydrophobicity which may facilitate protein association and anchoring to the viral membrane. This interaction might lead to a more stable association of the protein with the membrane. Double or triple alanine substitution for cysteine residues in MHV E protein was reported to significantly reduce virus-like particle (VLP) formation. In addition, the triple-mutated E proteins were found to be unstable, prone to degradation, and significantly reduced in terms of virus production. This indicates that palmitoylation of E protein is of paramount importance for viral assembly. Notably, although palmitoylation was found to be important for correct localization of some viral proteins, in the case of MHV E proteins, the addition of palmitic acid has no influence on the protein localization (Lopez et al., 2008; Schoeman and Fielding, 2019).\nThe fact that only a small portion of the E protein is incorporated into the viral envelope suggests that the protein has additional functions around the host cell's endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi region. The coronavirus E protein has a unique ability to form homotypic interaction leading to oligomerization and generation of viroporins (Schoeman and Fielding, 2019). Viroporins are integral hydrophobic viral proteins that form pores on host cell membranes, and affect the vesicle system of host cells, affect glycoprotein trafficking, and increase cellular membrane permeability, leading to the promotion of progeny virus particle release (Liao et al., 2006). Viroporins have also been suggested to play roles in pathogenesis. Although viroporins are not required for viral replication, their absence weakens or attenuates the virus and reduces its pathogenicity. The pores of the viroporins are hydrophilic. Generally, in forming a viroporin the hydrophobic residues of the protein line outside the pore oriented toward the phospholipid, while the inside of the pore is formed by the hydrophilic amino acids. The majority of the viroporins have an amphipathic α-helix in the hydrophobic domain and the pore is anchored to membrane by a cluster of positively charged amino acids through electrostatic interaction with the negatively charged phospholipids. Conformational changes in the structure regulate the ion flow by opening and closing of the pore (Schoeman and Fielding, 2019). Viroporins seem to selectively transport positively charged ions such as hydrogen (H+), potassium (K+), sodium (Na+) and calcium (Ca2+). The coronavirus E protein viroporins have been demonstrated to be selectively channeling monovalent cations, Na+ and K+ (Schoeman and Fielding, 2019). It is noteworthy that a deeper analysis of viroporin structure and function may provide novel strategies for development of antiviral therapeutics by blocking viroporin channel activity (Torres et al., 2015). Furthermore, due to the involvement of coronavirus E proteins in multiple critical aspects of the virus replication cycle, virus particles devoid of E protein may be a promising vaccine candidate (Schoeman and Fielding, 2019). The gene encoding the E protein has been targeted for coronavirus molecular detection (Setianingsih et al., 2019).\nThe coronavirus nucleocapsid (N) protein is a structural phosphoprotein of 43–46 kDa, a component of the helical nucleocapsid. The main function of the N protein is to package the viral genome into a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particle in order to protect the genomic RNA and for its incorporation into a viable virion. The N protein is thought to bind the genomic RNA in a beads-on-a-string fashion. In addition, it also interacts with the viral membrane protein during virion assembly and plays a critical role in improving the efficiency of virus transcription and assembly. The N protein undergoes rapid phosphorylation following its synthesis. In mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), phosphorylation occurs exclusively on serine residues. In infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), however, phosphorylation also takes place on threonine residues. The role of the phosphorylation is unclear but it has been hypothesized to have a regulatory significance. The 46 kDa N protein of the SARS-CoV shares 20%–30% identity with other coronavirus N proteins. It forms a dimer which constitutes the basic building block of the nucleocapsid through its C-terminus (Masters, 2006; Chang et al., 2014; McBride et al., 2014). The N protein is dynamically associated with the replication-transcription complexes (Verheije et al., 2010).\nBased on amino acid sequence comparisons it has been shown that the coronavirus N proteins have three distinct and highly conserved domains, namely the N terminal domain (NTD), the linker region (LKR) and the C-terminal domain (CTD). The NTD is separated from the CTD by the LKR, also termed an intrinsically disordered middle region (Figure 5\n). All of the three domains have been demonstrated to bind with viral RNA. The LKR includes a Ser/Arg-rich region (SR-motif) which contains a number of putative phosphorylation sites. The flexible LKR has the capability of direct interaction with RNA under in vitro conditions. The phosphorylation sites within the LKR are believed to play a role in binding M protein, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP-A1) and RNA to the N protein with high binding affinity (McBride et al., 2014; Chang et al., 2014).\nThe CTD, which is a hydrophobic helix-rich terminal, spans the amino acid residues 248 to 365 in SARS-N protein and amino acid residues 219 to 349 in IBV-N protein and is also called the dimerization domain because it contains residues responsible for self-association to form homodimers. The CTD also facilitates the formation of homo-oligomers through a domain-swapping mechanism. Oligomerization of the N protein is essential in order to generate a stable conformation. In its monomeric form, the CTD is unstable because it folds into an extended conformation with a large cavity in its center. Sequence comparison indicates that the dimerization domain of the N protein is conserved at least among the alpha, beta and gamma groups of coronaviruses, suggesting a common structural and functional role for this domain. The CTD contains the nuclear localization signal (NLS). Crystal structure analysis of the CTD of the SARS-CoV N protein covering residues 248–365, showed that the N protein dimer has the shape of a rectangular slab in which the four-stranded β-sheet forms one face of the slab and the α-helices form the opposite face (McBride et al., 2014).\nSelf-association of the N protein has been observed in many viruses, and is needed to form the viral capsid which provides protection to the viral genome from extracellular agents. In addition, the viral capsid is important for RNA-binding ability. The N protein fragment of SARS-CoV containing the dimerization domain has been demonstrated to be able to bind a putative packing signal (PS) within the viral RNA, with the most likely RNA binding site located within its basic region between residues 248–280. It was then revealed that the CTD, which spans residues 248–365, harbors eight positively charged lysine and arginine residues, forming a positively charged groove, one of the most positively charged regions of the N protein. The strong electrostatic nature of residues 248–280 suggests that oligonucleotide binding is based on interactions between the positively charged protein and the negatively charged backbone of the RNA molecule. The position of RNA-binding domains near the CTD is important for the formation of a large helical nucleocapsid core, and the association of the N protein dimers is necessary for further assembly of the core. In vitro studies showed that the full-length dimeric N protein has a tendency to form tetramers and higher molecular weight oligomers (McBride et al., 2014). The gene coding for the N protein is among the target genes for coronavirus molecular detection (Artika et al., 2020; Corman et al., 2020).\nAll coronavirus genomes contain accessory genes interspersed among the canonical genes, replicase, S, E, M, N which vary from as few as one (HCoV-NL63) to as many as eight genes (SARS-CoV). These accessory proteins are dispensable for coronavirus replication, however, they may confer biological advantages for the coronaviruses in the environment of the infected host cells. Some accessory proteins have been shown to exhibit roles in virus-host interaction and seem to have functions in viral pathogenesis. For SARS-CoV, some of the accessory proteins have been shown to be able to influence the interferon signaling pathways and the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Masters, 2006; McBride and Fielding, 2012; Liu et al., 2014). The accessory proteins encoded by the coronaviruses that infect humans are listed in Table 2\n(Masters, 2006; Wang et al., 2020b; Wu et al., 2020).\nThe eight SARS-CoV ORFs encoding for accessory protein are 3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a and 9b. Interestingly, these accessory proteins are found to be specific for SARS-CoV and have no significant homology to accessory proteins from other coronaviruses. The protein 3a is the largest accessory protein and is thought to play a role as a structural component of the SARS-CoV. It has been demonstrated to be incorporated into the virus-like particles (VLPs) although it is not essential for the VLP formation. In addition, the 3a protein has been shown to interact with the SARS-CoV structural proteins M, S, E, and the accessory protein 7a and may facilitate the SARS-CoV assembly. The 3a protein may also play roles in evading the host immune system. Moreover, it has been proposed that it functions as an ion channel through the use of its transmembrane domains (Liu et al., 2014). The protein 3b has been indicated to have the ability to induce necrosis and apoptosis and is also able to inhibit the host antiviral response by repressing type-I interferon production. The 3b protein is regarded as an interferon antagonist. The protein 6 is incorporated in VLPs when co-expressed with the SARS-CoV structural proteins S, M, E. The physical interaction of protein 6 with these structural proteins is hypothesized to be critical for its assembly into the VLP. The p6 protein has been identified as a β-interferon antagonist (Liu et al., 2014). The protein 7a is a minor structural protein which may facilitate viral assembly. It has been suggested that the 7a protein also important in SARS-CoV pathogenesis by inducing inflammatory responses (McBride and Fielding, 2012; Liu et al., 2014). More detailed molecular characterization is required for 7b, 8a, and 8b proteins. The 7b protein may act as an attenuation factor. The 8a protein has been indicated to have an ability to induce caspase-dependent apoptosis, while the 8b protein has been suggested to have an ability to induce DNA synthesis (Liu et al., 2014). The 9b protein may be a structural component of the SARS-CoV particle. It has been shown to be incorporated into the mature virion and packaged into VLPs when co-expressed with E and M proteins. The 9b protein may play a role during SARS-CoV assembly. In addition, it has been indicated to have an ability to induce caspase-dependent apoptosis (Liu et al., 2014).\nMost of the characterized coronavirus accessory proteins have been indicated to have a role in antagonizing the host response. The MERS-CoV accessory proteins have also been shown to be important for the virus pathogenesis. Deletion of four ORFs (ORF3, ORF4a, ORF4b, and ORF5) causes major impacts on viral replication and pathogenesis (Menachery et al., 2017). The ORF4a protein of the human coronavirus 229E has been shown to form homo-oligomers have ion channel activity and is suggested to function as a viroporin which is critical for regulating the viral reproduction. Functionally, it is analogous to the SARS-CoV 3a protein, which also plays a role as a viroporin that regulates virus production (Zhang et al., 2014). Similarly, the ns12.9 accessory protein of the human coronavirus OC43 has been shown to act as a viroporin involved in virion morphogenesis and pathogenesis (Zhang et al., 2015). The human coronavirus NL63 has one ORF encoding an accessory protein 3 (ORF3). The hCoV-NL63 ORF3 protein has been demonstrated to colocalize extensively with the E and M proteins within the ERGIC. It is incorporated into virions and therefore it functions as an additional structural protein (Müller et al., 2010).\nOne of the coronavirus accessory proteins which has been extensively studied is the haemagglutinin esterase (HE). The HE gene is found in the genome of Betacoronaviruses of A lineage, between orf1b and the S gene, and the encoded HE protein constitutes the fourth protein component of the viral membrane. The HE forms small spikes which appear below the tall S protein spikes. The HE monomer has an N-exo, and C-endo transmembrane topology. The mature protein forms a homodimer stabilized by disulfide bonds (Masters, 2006; Liu et al., 2014). The HE has haemagglutinating and acetylesterase activities. The protein facilitates viral-reversible attachment to O-acetylated sialic acids by acting both as lectin and as receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE). The HCoV-OC43, for example, uses 9-O-acetylated sialic acids as a receptor and possesses sialate-9-O-acetylesterases as its RDE. The HE also functions as a cofactor for S protein, facilitating viral attachment to the host cells (Masters, 2006; Zeng et al., 2008).\nThe genome of coronaviruses is a nonsegmented, single-stranded RNA molecule with positive sense (+ssRNA), which is, of the same sense as the mRNA. Structurally it is similar to most eukaryotic mRNAs, in having 5'caps and 3′ poly-adenine tails. One of the distinctive features of the coronavirus genome is its remarkably large size ranging from 26 to 32 kb. For comparison, this is approximately three times the size of alphavirus or flavivirus genomes and four times the size of picornavirus genomes. Indeed, the size of the coronavirus genomes is among the largest known viral genomic RNAs. The genomes contain multiple ORFs, encoding a fixed array of structural and nonstructural proteins, as well as a variety of accessory proteins which differ in number and sequence among the coronaviruses (Masters, 2006; Chen et al., 2020).\nAbout two-thirds of the 5′-most end of the genome is occupied by two large overlapping open reading frames, ORF1a and ORF1b. There is a -1 frameshift between ORF1a and ORF1b, leading to the synthesis of two polypeptides, pp1a and pp1ab, which are further processed by the viral proteases into 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps) which form the coronavirus replicase-transcriptase complex. This complex is an assembly of viral and hosts cellular proteins, which facilitate the synthesis of the genome and subgenome-sized mRNAs in the infected cell. The replicase-transcriptase complex plays an important role to amplify the genomic RNA and synthesize subgenomic mRNAs. Amplification of the genomic RNA involves full-length negative-strand templates, while the synthesis of subgenomic mRNA involves subgenome length negative-strand templates. The 16 nsps consist of nsp1– nsp11 encoded in ORF1a and nsp12–16 encoded in ORF1b. Studies in MHV-A59 have suggested that these proteins have multiple enzymatic functions, including papain-like proteases (nsp3), adenosine diphosphate-ribose 1,9-phosphatase (nsp3), 3C-like cysteine proteinase (nsp5), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), superfamily 1 helicase (nsp13), exonuclease (nsp14), endoribonuclease (nsp15), and S-adenosylmethionine-dependent 29-O-methyl transferase (nsp16) (Sawicki et al., 2005). The ORF1a and ORF1b have been targeted for molecular detection of coronaviruses (Setianingsih et al., 2019).\nThe remaining about one-third of the genome clustered at the 3′ end is transcribed into a nested set of subgenomic RNAs which contain ORFs for the structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N) as well as a variable number of accessory proteins depending on the viruses. The genes of accessory proteins are interspersed among the structural protein genes. Interestingly, there is an conserved gene order in all members of the coronavirus family, 5′-replicase-S-E-M-N-3’. However, genetic engineering experiments suggested that this evolutionary native order is not essential for functionality (Masters, 2006; Forni et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2020). Additionally, the genome has a 5′ UTR (untranslated region), ranging from 210 to 530 nucleotides, and 3′ UTR, ranging from 270 to 500 nucleotides (Masters, 2006). The 5′ 350 nucleotides folds into a set of RNA secondary structures which are well conserved, and in the Betacoronaviruses, have been suggested to play a critical role in the discontinuous synthesis of subgenomic RNAs. These functionally important cis-acting elements extend the 3′ of the 5′UTR into ORF1a. All of the 3′UTRs have a 3′-terminal poly(A) tail. The 3′UTR is similarly conserved and harbors all of the cis-acting sequences necessary for viral replication. All of the mRNAs carry identical 70–90 nucleotide leader sequences at their 5′ ends (Yang and Leibowitz, 2015). The organization of human-infecting coronavirus genomes is shown in Figure 6\n.\nThe coronavirus genome plays multiple functions during viral infection. It acts initially as an mRNA which is translated into two large replicase polyproteins. In fact, these polyproteins are the only translational products derived directly from the genome. All of the downstream ORFs are expressed from subgenomic RNAs. The genome then serves as a template for replication and transcription. Finally the genome plays a role in assembly, as progeny genomes are incorporated into progeny coronavirus particles (Masters, 2006). The expanded genome size of coronaviruses compared to other RNA viruses has been linked to the improved replication fidelity by acquiring genes for RNA processing enzymes. These include the RNA 3′-to-5′ exonuclease, and possibly an endonuclease. In addition, genome expansion is also considered to facilitate the acquisition of genes encoding for accessory proteins which are beneficial for coronaviruses to adapt to a specific host. These features are thought to underlie the propensity of coronaviruses to jump across species barriers to new hosts (Forni et al., 2017; Fan et al., 2019).\nThe infection of coronaviruses is initiated by the binding of the virus particles to the cellular receptors which leads to viral entry followed by fusion of the viral and host cellular membranes (Figure 7\n). The membrane fusion event allows the release of the viral genome into the host cells cytoplasm, a process known as uncoating, which makes the viral genome available for translation. Coronavirus entry is facilitated by the trimeric transmembrane spike (S) glycoprotein, which mediates receptor binding and fusion of the viral and host membranes. The interaction between the S protein and the cellular receptor is a main determinant of host species range and tissue tropism (Masters, 2006; Burkard et al., 2014). The S1 subunit (domain) of the coronavirus S proteins plays an important role in mediating the S protein binding to the host receptor. This S1 subunit shows the most diversity among coronaviruses and partly accounts for the wide host range of this virus family (Walls et al., 2017). Coronaviruses show complex patterns regarding receptor recognition and the diversity of receptor usage is one of the most profound features of coronaviruses (Li, 2016). The human cellular receptor for the coronaviruses is listed in Table 3\n.\nThe human CoV-229E employs human aminopeptidase N as a receptor. The human aminopeptidase N is a cell-surface metalloprotease on intestinal, lung, and kidney epithelial cells and is identical to CD13, a glycoprotein identified on granulocytes, monocytes, and their bone marrow progenitors (Yeager et al., 1992). In contrast to the human alphacoronavirus CoV-229E, the human alphacoronavirus NL63 utilizes heparan sulfate proteoglycans for its attachment to target cells. The human CoV-NL63 requires the ACE2 protein for entry but ACE2 is not the primary binding site on the cell surface. On the contrary, heparan sulfate proteoglycans was found to function as adhesion molecules, increasing the virus density on the surface of the cells and likely facilitating the interaction between human CoV-NL63 and its receptor. The heparan sulfate S proteoglycans therefore constitute the human CoV-NL63 adhesion receptors (Milewska et al., 2014). The human CoV-HKU1 (Huang et al., 2015) and human CoV-OC43 (Vlasak et al., 1988) use 9-O-acetylated sialic acid (9-O-Ac-Sia) as their receptor. Sialic acid is an ubiquitous residue of glycoconjugate terminally linked to oligosaccharide decorating glycoprotein and ganglioside at the surface of the host cells. It occurs in a wide variety of forms as a result of modifications of the core N-acetyl neuraminic acid molecule and of variations in glycosidic linkages. Cryo-electron microscopic structural data of human CoV-OC43 revealed that the sialic acid receptor binds to the groove located at the surface of domain A of the S1 subunit of the S glycoprotein (Tortorici et al., 2019). It should be noted that the human CoV-HKU1 (Huang et al., 2015) and human CoV-OC43 (Desforges et al., 2013) possess another viral surface protein, the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE), which is also a type I transmembrane glycoprotein. The HE protein plays a role as receptor-destroying enzyme, through sialate-O-acetyl-esterase activity, to promote release of viral progeny from infected cells and escape from attachment to resistant host cells (Tortorici et al., 2019).\nThe highly pathogenic human SARS-CoV (Li et al., 2003) and SARS-CoV-2 (Zhou et al., 2020) recognize the same receptor, the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 is a type I membrane protein found in lung, heart, kidneys, and intestine. It is a zinc-binding carboxypeptidase which plays a critical role in the maturation of angiotensin, a peptide hormone which regulates vasoconstriction and blood pressure. Additionally, ACE2 also functions as a chaperone for membrane trafficking of the amino acid transporter B0AT1 which facilitates uptake of neutral amino acids into intestine cells (Masters, 2006; Yan et al., 2020). The ACE2 protein has an N terminal peptidase domain (PD) and a C-terminal collectrin-like domain (CLD) that ends with a single transmembrane helix and an intracellular segment of more or less 40 amino acid residues. High resolution structural data of SARS-CoV-2 show that two S protein trimers can simultaneously bind to an ACE2 homodimer. In this interaction, each ACE2 PD accommodates one receptor binding domain (RBD) of S protein. The dimerization of ACE2 is mainly mediated by the neck domain of the protein involving an extensive network of polar interactions which stabilize dimer formation. Furthermore, structural information suggests that the overall SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV interfaces with ACE2 are similar, in spite that a number of sequence variations and conformational deviations are observed in their respective interfaces with ACE2 (Yan et al., 2020). Structural information at the atomic level also revealed that the overall structures of RBD and receptor binding motif (RBM) of the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are similar, supporting the nearly identical mode of their interaction with the ACE2 receptor (Lan et al., 2020). The overall structural similarity of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV binding to ACE2 receptor supports a close evolutionary relationship between the two viruses (Shang et al., 2020).\nThe receptor recognized by the MERS-CoV was identified to be dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) also known as CD26. The DPP4 is a multifunctional type-II transmembrane glycoprotein of 766 amino acid residues. It presents as a dimeric form on the cell surface. It has exopeptidase activity and preferentially cleaves dipeptides from hormones and chemokines at a site following a proline amino acid residue, important for controlling their bioactivity (Raj et al., 2013). This enzyme activity, however, is not required for viral entry. Intriguingly, DPP4 does not share any sequence or structural similarities to the previously identified human coronavirus receptors (Wang et al., 2013). Its abundance on epithelial and endothelial tissues has been thought to be the reason of its use as a receptor for the MERS-CoV (Raj et al., 2013). The crystal structure of RBD of the MERS-CoV spike (S) protein showed that the MERS-CoV RBD binds to the extracellular domain of human DPP4. MERS-CoV RBD is made up of a core and a receptor-binding subdomain. The extracellular domain of DPP4 is comprised by an N terminal eight-bladed β-propeller domain and a C-terminal α/β-hydrolase domain. The receptor-binding subdomain of the MERS-CoV RBD was revealed to interact with the DPP4 β-propeller but not with the intrinsic hydrolase domain. The β-propeller domain is comprised by eight blades, each consists of four antiparallel β-strands. The DPP4 employs the blades 4 and 5 to interact to MERS-CoV RBD. This contact site is located distant from the hydrolase domain (Wang et al., 2013). Structural studies of the MERS-CoV spike (S) trimers using single particle cryo-electron microscopy showed that the S protein has a flexible RBD which can readily be approached by the receptors to bind and guarantee virus entry (Yuan et al., 2017).\nFollowing receptor binding, the fusion between the viral envelope and host cell membranes occurs mediated by the viral transmembrane fusion proteins, termed fusogens. In general, based on their structure, there are four different classes of virus-cell membrane fusion proteins. Class I virus-cell fusion proteins are α-helix-rich prefusion trimers which form central coiled-coil structures which insert hydrophobic fusion peptides (or loops) into membranes and refold into postfusion trimmers of α-helical hairpins. Class II virus-cell fusogens have a structural signature of β-sheet-rich prefusion homo- or hetero-dimers which insert fusion loops into membranes, ending in postfusion trimers. These Class II proteins lack of the central coiled coil. Class III virus-cell fusogens exhibit a combination of α-helical and β-structure identified in classes I and II. They are trimers with both α-helices and β-sheets that dissociate into monomers, insert fusion loops into membranes, and oligomerize into postfusion trimers. Class IV reoviral cell-cell fusogens are the smallest identified viral-encoded fusion proteins with fusion loops which oligomerize to fuse membranes (Podbilewicz, 2014). The coronavirus spike (S) protein belongs to the class I viral fusion protein which has a similar function to the fusion proteins of phylogenetically distant RNA viruses such as influenza virus, HIV, and Ebola virus. It requires protease cleavage for activation of fusion capability (Masters, 2006; Walls et al., 2017; Ou et al., 2020). Betacoronavirus spike (S) proteins are processed into S1 and S2 subunits by host proteases. The proteolytic cleavage of the S proteins is essential to induce dissociation of S1 from S2 as a trigger that directly leads to membrane fusion (Li, 2016; Kirchdoerfer et al., 2016). This proteolytic activation step permits for controlled release of the fusion peptide into target cellular membranes. The host proteases shown to function in cleaving the coronavirus spike proteins include, but are not limited to, furin, trypsin, elastase, transmembrane protease/serine subfamily member 2 (TMPRSS2), lysosomal cathepsin L and cathepsin B. In addition to receptor binding and proteolysis of S proteins, membrane fusion may also be triggered by low pH. Protease cleavage at S2′ (Figure 2a) is thought to follow S1/S2 cleavage and may not occur until host-receptor engagement at the plasma membrane or viral endocytosis (Millet and Whitakker, 2015; Li, 2016; Kirchdoerfer et al., 2016). It should be noted that SARS-CoV S protein is not proteolytically cleaved during biosynthesis and the virus does not require a S1/S2 pre-cleavage event for plasma membrane fusion. As the S1/S2 cleavage event is believed to be essential for conformational changes that further expose the S2’ site for immediate plasma membrane fusion, there may be alternative mechanisms to cause these conformational rearrangements, such as receptor binding. Interestingly, the S protein of the SARS-CoV-2 possesses a potential furin cleavage site in the S1/S2 region, which is unique to SARS-like coronaviruses (Tang et al., 2020).\nMembrane fusion is a critical event in the coronavirus life cycle which occurs following receptor binding, when the viral and the host cell membranes are proximal. Depending on protease availability, there are two routes for coronavirus entry and membrane fusion, the early (plasma membrane) pathway and the late (endosome) pathway. If the plasma membrane proteases are available, the virus can fuse through the early pathway at the plasma membrane. For example, the presence of exogeneous and membrane bound proteases, such as trypsin and TMPRSS2, can stimulate the early fusion pathway. In the absence of plasma membrane proteases, the coronavirus will be internalized via clathrin- and non-clathrin-mediated endocytosis and thus achieve membrane fusion via a late pathway at the endosomal membrane. As the virus is transported towards the host cell interior, the pH in the endosome decreases. This increasing acidity can activate cathepsin L to trigger fusion at the endosomal membrane. It has been shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 can enter cells either using an early pathway or a late pathway, depending on protease availability and cell type (Tang et al., 2020).\nOf note, the membrane fusion is not a spontaneous process, as it needs high energy to bring the membranes close together. In this process, the viral fusion protein plays a critical role as a catalyst by providing the energy required to drive the reaction (Tang et al., 2020). The coronavirus S glycoprotein exists as a metastable prefusion protein at the viral surface (Walls et al., 2017). Studies of HKU1 S protein revealed that in the prefusion conformation, the receptor-binding subunits (S1) rest above the fusion-mediating subunits (S2), preventing their conformational rearrangement. The membrane fusion needs progressive S protein destabilization through receptor binding and proteolytic cleavage (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2016). As for MERS-CoV, the S protein may have two proteolytic cleavage sites, the S1/S2 and the S2′ cleavage sites. It is suggested that all coronaviruses need the cleavage site on S2’ for membrane fusion to be accomplished (Hulswit et al., 2016). The receptor binding and proteolytic cleavages trigger large-scale conformation changes which initiate the fusion reaction involving insertion of the hydrophobic fusion peptide into the host membrane. This irreversible refolding of the fusion machinery provides the energy needed to bring the viral and host membrane close together leading to membrane fusion through the S2 domain. The postfusion conformation state of the S protein represents its most stable conformation with the lowest energy point (Lim et al., 2016; Walls et al., 2017).\nThe replication of the coronavirus genome is viewed as the most fundamental aspect of the coronavirus biology. As the largest group of RNA virus, coronaviruses require an RNA synthesis machinery with the fidelity to faithfully replicate their RNA. Coronavirus replication is achieved by employing complex mechanisms involving various proteins encoded by both viral and host cell genomes. Evolutionary, the virus genome contains relatively constant replicative genes which are indispensable for viral replication. Despite undergoing high mutation rates, RNA viral genomes still encode proteins with arrays of conserved sequence motifs playing roles in facilitating their genome replication and expression. Such proteins include the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), RNA helicase, chymotrypsin-like proteases, papain-like proteases, and metal binding proteins. In coronavirus genomes, all of the genes encoding these proteins are located in the ORF1 strategically located at the 5′-most end of the genome. In addition, viruses also exploit cellular proteins for multiple purposes in their replication cycle, including the attachment and entry into the cells, the initiation and regulation of RNA replication and transcription, protein synthesis, and the assembly of progeny virions. For these purposes, viruses typically subvert the normal components of cellular RNA processing and translational machinery to play both integral and regulatory roles in the replication, transcription, and translation of the viral genomes (Shi and Lai, 2005).\nSoon after the accomplishment of receptor binding and membrane fusion events which lead to the release and uncoating of the viral RNA genome, the genomic replication cycle is started. In line with all other positive (+)-stranded RNA viruses, a coronavirus replicates its genome through synthesis of a complementary negative (‒)-strand RNA using the genomic RNA as a template. Firstly, using a continuous transcription process, the genome-size positive (+) stranded RNA is used as a template to make the genome-size negative (‒)-stranded RNA which subsequently serves as a template for the synthesis of the genome-size positive (+) stranded RNA progenies. Astonishingly, a coronavirus also synthesizes a number of shorter negative (‒)-stranded RNA of various sizes through discontinuous transcription process. These subgenome-length negative (‒)-stranded RNA molecules subsequently serve as templates for producing a number of positive (+) stranded RNAs of various sizes, termed subgenomic RNAs. For examples, during replication of MHV-A59, six subgenomic mRNA molecules are produced. The coronavirus genome and subgenomic mRNAs share identical 3′ sequences and form a 3′ nested set of RNA molecules. Interestingly, only the ORF at the 5’ region of each subgenomic mRNA is translated into a unique protein. Notably, the positive strands (genomes and subgenomic mRNA) are produced in relatively large amounts compared to the negative strands of genome- and subgenome-length RNA which serve as templates for genome and subgenomic mRNA synthesis (Sawicki and Sawicki, 2005).\nAs mentioned earlier, about two-third of the 5′-end of the coronavirus genomic RNA (ORF1a and ORF1b) are translated into two polypeptides, pp1a and pp1ab, which further undergo proteolytic cleavage process by proteases encoded by the ORF1a into 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps). Together with cellular proteins, these 16 nonstructural proteins are thought to form the replicase-transcriptase complex (RTC). The nonstructural proteins generated include the papain-like proteases (PLpro), adenosine diphosphate-ribose 19-phosphatase, 3chymotrypsin-like cysteine proteinase (3CLpro), RdRp, helicase (Hel), exonuclease (ExoN), endoribonuclease, and S-adenosylmethionine-dependent 29-O-methyl transferase, etc. The roles of most nonstructural proteins have been reported. However, the roles of nsp2 and nsp 11 are unknown. The remaining one-third of the genome is transcribed into subgenomic RNAs for production of structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleoprotein (N) and a variable number of accessory proteins (Sawicki et al., 2005; de Wit et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2020).\nSimilar to many other positive (+) sense RNA viruses, coronaviruses use proteolytic processing to control expression of their replicative protein machineries. The critical roles of the pp1a/pp1ab polyprotein processing in genomic replication of coronaviruses are demonstrated by the prevention of RNA biosynthesis by proteinase inhibitors blocking essential proteolytic cleavages. Based on their physiological role, coronavirus proteinases are classified into main proteinases and accessory proteinases. All coronaviruses encode one main proteinase (Ziebuhr, 2005), called 3chymotrypsin-like cysteine proteinase (3CLpro). These are indications of a similarity of cleavage-site specificity with that of picornavirus 3C proteinases (3Cpro), although the structural similarities were found to be limited (Anand et al., 2003). The coronavirus 3CLpro is a cysteine protease that forms a homodimer for its proteolytic activity with one active site per subunit. Dimerization of this enzyme is critical for shaping a substrate-binding pocket at its active site (Muramatsu et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2020a). The proposed catalytic residues His41 and Cys145 are essential for 3CLpro catalytic activity. Mutations His41 to Ala, and Cys145 to Ser, resulted in a 40-fold reduction in activity (Huang et al., 2004). A number coronavirus 3CLpro crystal structures have been reported. The 3CLpro subunit is made up of N-terminal finger (residues 1–8), catalytic domain (residues 8–184), and a C-terminal domain (residues 201–306). The overall domain structures are the same among all of the reported 3CLpro enzymes (Muramatsu et al., 2016). Recently, the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro was elucidated. Its 3D structure was found to be very similar to that of SARS-CoV, consistent with a 96% sequence identity between the two polypeptides. The recognition sequence of the main proteinases at most sites is Leu-Gln↓(Ser, Ala, Gly) (↓ indicates the cleavage site) (Zhang et al., 2020a). The roles of the 3CLpro is to cleave the major part of the polyproteins at 11 conserved sites and release the conserved replicative machinery such as the RdRp, helicase, and three RNA processing domains. The 3CL pro is also responsible for cleaving itself from the polyproteins. The coronavirus 3CLpro shows both cis and trans activity (Chuck et al., 2011). Generally, most of the pp1a/pp1ab cleavages are mediated by the trans activity of the fully processed form of 3CLpro (Ziebuhr, 2005).\nDepending on the virus, there may be one or two accessory proteinases produced. The function of the accessory proteinases is to cleave the more divergent N-proximal pp1a/pp1ab regions at two or three sites. The accessory proteinases are papain-like cysteine proteinases (PLpro). The MHV and HCoV-229E encode two PLpros, the PL1pro and the PL2pro. In the case of MHV, the PL1pro cuts the nsp1/nsp2 and nsp2/nsp3 sites, and the PL2pro cleaves the nsp3/nsp4 site. For HCoV-229E, the PL1pro cleaves the nsp1/nsp2 and nsp2/nsp3 sites, however, the PL2pro cleaves the nsp3/nsp4 site and can also act at the nsp2/nsp3 site. The infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was reported to have only one proteolytically active PLpro, the PL2pro, because the PL1pro domain has lost its proteolytic activity due to accumulation of mutations in its active site during IBV evolution. Similarly, the SARS-CoV encodes only one PLpro corresponding to the PL2pro. It is therefore suggested that the SARS-CoV PL2pro is responsible for processing all of the three sites at the N-proximal pp1a/pp1ab regions (Ziebuhr, 2005). Due to their critical roles in coronavirus replication, especially in processing the polyproteins translated from the viral RNA, the 3CLpro along with the PLpro have been considered as putative antiviral drug targets. By targeting the viral proteases, the production of RdRp and helicase is inhibited, hence, the replication and transcription of the coronavirus genome will be disrupted (Gaurav and Al-Nema, 2019). It worthy to note, as no human proteases have a similar cleavage specificity to 3CLpro, specific inhibitors of 3CLpro are expected to be nontoxic (Zhang et al., 2020a). Three flavonoid compounds, herbacetin, rhoifolin and pectolinarin were reported to efficiently block the proteolytic activity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro (Jo et al., 2020). It is important to note that although the main function of the PLpro and 3CLpro is to proteolytically cleave the viral polyprotein in a coordinated manner, PLpro has an additional role to strip ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like interferon-stimulated gene product 15 (ISG15) from host-cell proteins, in order to help coronaviruses in generally to evade the host innate immune responses. Therefore, targeting PLpro with antiviral drugs has the potential advantage of not only inhibiting viral replication, but also preventing the dysregulation of signaling cascades in infected cells which may lead to cell death in surrounding, healthy cells (Báez-Santos et al., 2015).\nThe coronavirus RNA helicase represents the second most conserved protein for RNA synthesis and resides in the nsp13 domain. Based on conservation of specific sequence motifs, RNA helicases of positive (+) sense RNA viruses are classified into three large super-families, SF1, SF2 and SF3. The coronavirus RNA helicase belongs to the SF1 super-family (Ziebuhr, 2005). It is a motor protein which functions in an energy-dependent manner responsible for unwinding double-stranded RNA molecule using energy derived from the hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs). All natural nucleotides and deoxynucleotides are substrates for coronavirus helicases, with ATP, dATP, and GTP being hydrolyzed slightly more efficiently than other nucleotides (Ivanov et al., 2004). Crystal structure analysis of full-length MERS-CoV helicase revealed that the enzyme possesses multiple domains, including an N-terminal Cys/His rich domain (CH) with three zinc atoms, a beta-barrel domain and two helicase core domains, the RecA1 and RecA2 domains. In addition, there is a stalk region connecting the CH domain and the beta-barrel domain. The CH domain has 15 conserved Cys/His residues, twelve of which participate in the coordination of the three zinc ions. In general, organization of the helicase domain is conserved throughout Nidoviruses and the individual domains of MERS-CoV are closely related to the equivalent eukaryotic domains of SF1 Up-frameshift 1 (Upf1) helicases (Hao et al., 2017). Although coronaviruses replicate their genomic RNA in the hosts cytoplasm, and the viral helicase may not localize to the nucleus of the cells (Ziebuhr, 2005), it has been shown that the MERS-CoV helicase possesses both RNA and DNA unwinding activity (Adedeji and Lazarus, 2016). The helicase activity can be enhanced by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The two enzymes are central components of the RTC. The coronavirus helicase has been identified as an ideal target for the development of anti-viral drugs because of its sequence conservation and indispensability across all coronavirus species (Hao et al., 2017; Jia et al., 2019).\nThe majority of viruses spend their entire life cycle in the cytoplasm of the host cells and have no access to the host polymerases. Therefore, viruses have to encode polymerases essential for their own transcription and replication (Gaurav and Al-Nema, 2019). For RNA viruses, the RdRp is the most conserved viral domain and is the most fundamental component of the viral replicase machinery (Shi and Lai, 2005; Ziebuhr, 2005). The RdRp domain of coronaviruses locates in the C-terminal part of nsp12 which catalyzes the replication and transcription of the coronavirus RNA genome. The size of the coronavirus nsp12 is about 930 amino acid residues which is larger than other known viral RdRp's, commonly about 500–600 amino acid residues. The C-terminal part, which represents about two-thirds of nsp12, has been found to align with the common viral RdRp subunit (Gaurav and Al-Nema, 2019). Structure analysis of the SARS-CoV nsp12 polymerase showed that the nsp12 polymerase binds to its essential co-factors, nsp7-nsp8 heterodimer, with a second nsp8 subunit occupying a distinct binding site. The presence of nsp7 and nsp8 co-factors significantly increases the RdRp activity. The polymerase domain consists of a fingers domain, a palm domain and a thumb domain. The SARS-CoV nsp12 also contains a Nidovirus-unique N-terminal extension. Notably, the SARS-CoV nsp12 contains two zinc-binding sites, one in the Nidovirus-unique extension and the other in the fingers domain. Both of these zinc-binding sites are distal to the active sites, suggesting that the ions are structural components of the folded protein and probably not involved in the enzymatic activity. Interestingly, all viral polymerases possess seven conserved motif regions (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) involved in template and nucleotide binding and catalysis (Kirchdoerfer and Ward, 2019). Similarly, cryo-electron microcopy structure of the nsp12 of the SARS-CoV-2 showed that it has a “right hand” RdRp domain and Nidovirus-unique N-terminal extension domain that adopts a Nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN) architecture. The polymerase domain and NiRAN domain are connected by an interface (Gao et al., 2020). Domain organization of the COVID-19 virus nsp12 is shown in Figure 8\n.\nA homology model of SARS-CoV RdRp based on crystal structures of other known RNA viruses provided pivotal information about the potential functional roles of the conserved motifs and specific residues in the polymerization reaction. For example, the highly conserved Asp618 and Asp623 in motif A are proposed to function in metal ion chelation and recognition of a rNTP sugar ring, respectively. The Ser682 and Thr687 in motif B are hypothesized to play roles in recognition of template-primer, etc. Furthermore, it was suggested that the catalytic core of the SARS-CoV RdRp is formed by the Asp618 of motif A along with the Asp760 and Asp761 in motif C. These three aspartates are likely involved in binding divalent metal ions required for catalysis (Gaurav and Al-Nema, 2019). RdRp performs essentially the same basic replication and transcription functions as all the other viral polymerases, i.e., to copy the RNA template strand to generate a daughter strand. The process involves transfer of a nucleotidyl moiety of incoming NTP (complementary to template strand) to the 3ʹ-end of a growing RNA daughter strand. The polymerase needs two divalent metal cations, Mg2+/Mn2+ for activity. The polymerase active site has binding sites for the template strand, primer and the incoming NTP. The reaction is started by binding of template-primer and NTP, followed by incorporation of nucleoside monophosphate into the growing daughter strand with the release of pyrophosphate, and then translocation of the template strand and growing daughter strand (Gaurav and Al-Nema, 2019).

Remdesivir is a nucleotide analog inhibitor of RdRps. The triphosphate form of Remdesivir (RDV-TP) competes with its natural counterpart ATP. Interestingly, RDV-TP seems to be more efficiently incorporated than ATP. After incorporated, <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightorange; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">Remdesivir<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">chemical</span>\n</mark> arrests RNA synthesis which most likely leads to delayed RNA chain termination (Gordon et al., 2020). In addition, the RdRp gene, located at the 5’ region of ORF 1b (Figure 6), has been an important target for coronavirus molecular detection by PCR (Artika et al., 2020; Corman et al., 2020).\nApart from virally encoded proteins, coronavirus replication also employs several cellular proteins, such as the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A 1 (hnRNP-A1), polypyrimidine-tract-binding (PTB) protein, poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), and mitochondrial aconitase. As typical for viruses, coronavirus may hijack these cellular proteins from their normal roles to function in the viral replication process. The fact that no coronavirus proteins in an infected cell extract could be cross-linked to the viral RNA in vitro, suggests that viral proteins may interact with viral RNA only indirectly through the mediation of cellular proteins. Of note is that a number of cellular proteins have been shown to bind to the regulatory elements of MHV RNA. In MHV, the RNA-binding cellular hnRNP-A1 has been suggested to play roles in the regulation of coronavirus transcription. It may also function in facilitating mRNA translation. Similarly, the PTB has also been suggested to regulate viral mRNA translation. The PABP has been revealed to interact specifically with poly(A), which is an important cis-acting signal for coronavirus RNA replication. Because coronavirus RNA is capped and polyadenylated similar to the host mRNAs, PABP is also thought to function in the translation of the coronavirus genome upon virus entry into the cells, which is required for efficient coronavirus RNA replication. The mitochondrial aconitase has been shown to bind specifically to the 3′ protein-binding element of the MHV genomic RNA and has been suggested to interact with the MHV replication complexes. In addition, it is hypothesized that the binding of the mitochondrial aconitase to the 3′-UTR of the MHV genomic RNA increases the stability of the viral mRNAs and hence improves the translation of viral proteins. It is believed that additional host cellular proteins may also interact with coronavirus RNA and are essential for viral replication (Shi and Lai, 2005).\nCoronavirus genomic replication and transcription occurs in the cytoplasm of the hosts involving coronavirus-induced host membranous rearrangements of varying morphologies that serve as platforms for the viral replication and transcription complexes (RTCs). These organelle-like replicative structures act as a framework for viral genome replication by localizing and concentrating the necessary factors and most likely providing protection from the anti-viral host defense mechanisms of the infected cell. The biogenesis of these replicative structures involves the concerted actions of hijacked host and viral membrane shaping proteins, lipid-modifying enzymes and various exploited cellular pathways. The coronavirus-induced replicative structures are mostly in the form of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) and convoluted membranes (CMs), interconnected with a reticulovesicular network of modified membranes, which seem to be continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The replicase proteins are localized to the DMVs and CMs. These replicative structures together with their localized proteins, are called the replication-transcription complex (RTC). The double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) believed to function as replicative intermediate during viral RNA synthesis was detected in the interior of the DMVs. Additional small double-membrane spherule-like structures associated with “zippered” ER membranes were also observed in infectious bronchitis virus (IBV)-infected cells, but not in SARS-CoV, MHV- or MERS-CoV-infected cells (Angelini et al., 2013: Hagemeijer et al., 2014). Studies of SARS-CoV-infected cells showed that the nonstructural proteins, nsp3, nsp4 and nsp6 play roles in inducing the formation of the double-membrane vesicles. It is worth noting that among the 16 nsps, these three proteins contain multiple hydrophobic, membrane-spanning domains. The luminal loops of the nsp3 and nsp4 are critical for formation of the replicative structures (Angelini et al., 2013; Hagemeijer et al., 2014). Together, nsp3 and nsp4 were shown to be able to pair membranes. The nsp6 alone has the ability to induce the formation small spherical single-membrane vesicles around host cells microtubule-organizing centers. In collaboration, the nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6 have the ability to induce double-membrane vesicles (Angelini et al., 2013). A small chemical compound designated K22 has been identified as a potent inhibitor of double-membrane vesicle formation. Furthermore, the K22 nearly totally prevented viral RNA synthesis. Hence, it has been suggested as a potential anti-coronavirus drug (Lundin et al., 2014).\nBeing obligate intracellular parasites, coronaviruses also exploit the translational apparatus of the infected cell in order to synthesize their proteins, in a process which may accompanied by inhibition of the hosts cellular protein synthesis. The process of protein synthesis in typical eukaryotic cells, which occurs in cytoplasm, involves an initiation step, in which the mRNA is recognized by the host translational machinery, and a methionyl initiator tRNA (Met-tRNAMet) binds at the ribosomal peptidyl (P) site to read the start codon of the mRNA. This is followed by an elongation step in which aminoacyl tRNAs enter the acceptor (A) site and, if the correct tRNA is bound, the formation of a peptide bond is catalyzed by the ribosome. The following step is the translocation of the tRNAs and mRNA such that the next codon is moved into the A site, and the process is repeated. When a stop codon is encountered, the translation process is terminated, followed by the release of the peptide from the ribosome (Nakagawa et al., 2016). It is important to note that similar to the eukaryotic mRNAs, the 5’ ends of coronavirus mRNAs are capped and methylated. This is believed to help viral RNAs escape from recognition by the host innate immune system (Chen and Guo, 2016). Coronavirus protein synthesis involves a cap-dependent translation mechanism. In addition, the process also employs regulatory mechanisms, such as ribosomal frameshifting. After the virus successfully enters the cell, the viral genome RNA is translated to synthesize the viral proteins which are necessary for subsequent RNA replication and transcription. This process results in polyprotein (pp) 1a and 1ab. As mentioned earlier, the synthesis of pp1ab involves a minus 1 (-1) ribosomal frameshift until the translation stop codon is reached. Therefore, the polyprotein 1ab is encoded by a (functionally) fused ORF produced from the two ORFs 1a and 1b (Nakagawa et al., 2016). For the structural proteins, after synthesis, the S, E, and M proteins are inserted into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. From there, these structural proteins travel along the secretory pathway to the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi apparatus intermediate compartment (ERGIC) which is the location of the coronavirus particle assembly (Tang et al., 2020).\nOne of the distinctive features of coronaviruses is the location of their virion assembly. For most enveloped viruses, virion assembly takes place at the host cells plasma membrane. For coronaviruses, however, virion budding and assembly occurs at the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). Coronaviruses, therefore, obtain their membrane envelope from ERGIC (Ujike and Taguchi, 2015; Schoeman and Fielding, 2019). For efficient coronavirus virion assembly, the three membrane (enveloped) proteins must be retained near the ERGIC. In fact, the M, E and some S proteins have intracellular trafficking signals which target these structural proteins to the budding site where they accumulate. Therefore, the efficiency of viral proteins incorporation into coronavirus virions is determined by protein trafficking to the ERGIC and protein–protein interactions at the ERGIC (Ujike and Taguchi, 2015). Studies of SARS-CoV have revealed that following translation, four structural proteins, the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, enter the secretory pathway in the ERGIC, where they are assembled into virions (Woo et al., 2019). Most of the protein-protein interactions required for coronavirus assembly are mediated by the M proteins. The coronavirus packaging signal (PS), a cis-regulatory element encoded within the viral RNA, functions in packaging the viral genome into the ribonucleocapsid (Woo et al., 2019). The nucleocapsid (N) phosphoprotein plays a fundamental role during viral self-assembly and one of its critical functions is to form the viral genome into a helical ribonucleocapsid (ribonucleoprotein, RNP). Viral N–N self-interactions are thought to be necessary for formation of the ribonucleocapsid and subsequent assembly of the viral particles (Chang et al., 2014).\nIn the presence of a great excess of subgenomic RNA species, coronaviruses have the ability to select the genomic positive (+) sense single stranded RNA to be packaged into assembled virions. This high degree of selectivity is mediated by the coronaviruses genomic PS, a critical element for genomic RNA packaging, originally identified in MHV (Kuo and Masters, 2013). One of the most characterized PS elements, called psi, is located at the 5′ leader region of the HIV genome. Two viral proteins, the N protein and the M protein, have been suggested to play roles in recognizing the PS. The coronavirus N protein has two highly basic domains, the NTD and CTD, and a mostly acidic carboxy-terminal domain, termed N3 within the C-terminal tail (CT) (Figure 5). The CTD and the N3 domains have been proposed to recognize the PS (Masters, 2019). In vivo studies of SARS-CoV have also indicated that both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of the N protein are crucial for recognition in the packaging RNA (Woo et al., 2019). Notably, the N protein plays a critical role to wrap the viral genome into a helical nucleoprotein which is bound to the network of M endodomains at the site of virion budding, at the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment. The association of the N and M molecules is mediated by their respective carboxy termini. Because the M protein is the most abundant virion structural protein, there should be sufficient M endodomain tails on the internal surface of the virion membrane to interact with the domain N protein in the nucleocapsid. In addition, the M protein (possibly with the assistance of E) has also been hypothesized to recognize and bind to the PS (Masters, 2019).\nOnce the viral gene expression and genome replication is ongoing, coronavirus progenies can begin to assemble. The coronavirus M protein has been recognized as the central organizer for the virion assembly (Masters, 2006). The M protein has the ability to form virus-like particles (VLPs) in the presence of N protein or E protein, suggesting its pivotal role in the virion assembly (Tseng et al., 2010). The coronavirus assembly is likely mediated by specific interactions of the M protein with S, N, and E proteins. However, the detailed molecular mechanism of N protein packaging inside the virion and the interaction between N and other proteins has yet to be elucidated (Chang et al., 2014). The E protein has been suggested to play roles in inducing membrane curvature which permits coronavirus particles to acquire their spherical shape and morphology (Schoeman and Fielding, 2019). The generation of mature virions involves insertion into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of the coronavirus structural proteins, S, E, and M. These proteins travel along the secretory pathway into the ERGIC and are inserted into the membrane of the ERGIC. The ERGIC is also a location where the viral genomes are encapsidated by the N protein. The structural proteins then interact with the encapsidated viral genomes and assemble into mature coronavirus particles by budding (Fehr and Perlman, 2015). Following assembly, the progeny virions accumulate in smooth-walled vesicles are transported to the cell surface, and released into the extracellular space through exocytosis or cell lysis (Orenstein et al., 2008) (Figure 7).\nAnalysis of full-length genome sequences of five patients from the early outbreak stages of the SARS-CoV-2 (alternatively called 2019-nCoV) showed that these genomes sequences were almost identical to each other, with more than 99.9% sequence identity. The length of the genomes obtained was 29,891 bases which shared 79.6% identity to SARS-CoV. As with other coronaviruses, the SARS-CoV-2 genome harbors six major ORFs and a number of ORFs which encode accessory proteins. Further analysis indicated that some of the SARS-CoV-2 genes have less than 80% nucleotide sequence identity to the corresponding genes of SARS-CoV. However, when amino acid sequences of seven conserved replicase domains in ORF1ab (used for coronavirus species classification) were compared, there was 94.4% sequence identity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. It was concluded that the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are of the same species, both being SARS related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) (Zhou et al., 2020). Interestingly, further studies showed that the full-length genome of SARS-CoV-2 has high similarity to the genome of a bat coronavirus, BatCoVRaTG13, detected in Rhinolophus affinis, with overall sequence identity of 96.2%. Phylogenetic analysis was then carried out for the full-length genome, the spike gene, and the RdRp gene. Results showed that RaTG13 is the closest relative of the SARS-CoV-2 and they form a distinct lineage from the other SARSr-CoVs. The close phylogenetic relationship to RaTG13 suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 may have originated in bats (Zhou et al., 2020). Similarly, other studies showed that genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 obtained from nine patients among the early outbreak cases are almost identical to each other. The genome sequences also suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 is most closely related to other betacoronaviruses of bat origin, indicating that bats are the most likely reservoir hosts for SARS-CoV-2 (Lu et al., 2020). However, several facts suggested that another animal might function as an intermediate host between bats and humans. In addition to the general ecological separation of bats from humans, the outbreaks occurred when most bats in Wuhan were hibernating and no bats were sold or found in the Huanan seafood market the site which was linked to the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, other mammalian species may act as an intermediate or amplifying host, allowing SARS-CoV-2 to acquire mutations needed for efficient transmission to humans. Notably, in the case of SARS and MERS, civets and camels, played a role as intermediate hosts, respectively (Lu et al., 2020; Zhang and Holmes, 2020).\nExploring the potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 is critical for blocking its interspecies transmission. In attempt to discover intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2, Zhang et al. (2020b) analyzed published genomic sequence data of SARS-CoV-like coronaviruses. They found that a SARS-CoV-2-like coronavirus, named Pangolin-CoV, isolated from Malayan pangolins shows 91.02% genomic identity to SARS-CoV-2 and 90.55% identity to the BatCoV RaTG13. The high overall sequence identity of the Pangolin-CoV to the SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 indicated that Pangolin-CoV could be the second closest relative of SARS-CoV-2 after RaTG13, and Pangolin-CoV is likely the common origin of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 (Zhang et al., 2020b). Interestingly, the S1 protein of Pangolin-CoV is much more closely related to that in SARS-CoV-2 compared to that in RaTG13, with five key amino acids in the RBD being involved in recognition of human ACE2, are completely consistent between Pangolin-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, four amino acid changes are found in RaTG13 (Zhang et al., 2020b). Similarly, Lam et al. (2020) identified SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses in Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) with genome sequence similarity of 85.5%–92.4% to genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, they also investigated SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses from Guangdong pangolins. Interestingly, the RBD domain of the Guangdong pangolin coronaviruses shared 97.4% sequence similarity to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2. The Guangdong pangolin coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 possess identical amino acids at the five critical residues of the RBD, while RaTG13 only shares one amino acid with SARSCoV-2. The high similarity of pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses to SARS-CoV-2 suggests that these pangolins should be considered as possible hosts of SARS-CoV-2 and may play critical roles in the emergence of novel coronaviruses generally (Lam et al., 2020). As most of the laboratory-confirmed cases of the initial SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks were linked to the Wuhan seafood market, identification of source or intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 was focused on animals which also sold in the market such as snakes, birds and other small mammals. However, no specific animal associated with SARS-CoV-2 was conclusively identified. Owing to fact that the genetic sequences of pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 show high similarity, the most likely intermediate host candidate is believed to be pangolin (Prompetchara et al., 2020).\nThe SARS-CoV-2 has been spreading rapidly and globally. The surface-exposed transmembrane spike (S) glycoprotein plays an important role in mediating coronavirus entry into the host cells. Therefore, molecular characterization of SARS-CoV-2 S protein is highly important. It was found that the S gene of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 was longer than those of other SARS related coronaviruses. Other important differences in the S gene of SARS-CoV-2 include three short insertions in the N terminal domain and changes in four out of five key residues in the receptor binding motif (RBM) compared with the S gene sequences of SARS-CoV. The significant of these changes needs further elucidation (Zhou et al., 2020). Furthermore, virus infectivity experiments employing HeLa cell lines which express or do not express human ACE2 proteins were aimed to determine the SARS-CoV-2 receptor usage. Results confirmed that the SARS-CoV-2 uses the human ACE2 as an entry receptor, the same as the SARS-CoV. The experiments also showed that the SARS-CoV-2 does not employ other coronavirus receptors such as the aminopeptidase N (APN) and the dipeptidylpeptidase 4 (DPP4) (Zhou et al., 2020).\nIn attempt to reveal the structural basis of receptor recognition by SARS-CoV-2, Shang and coworkers (2020) elucidated the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) in a complex with human ACE2. They found that compared to the SARS-CoV RBD, the binding of SARS-CoV-2 RBD to human ACE2 results in a more compact conformation. In addition, some residues changes in SARS-CoV-2 RBD stabilize the virus-binding hotspots at the interface between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and human ACE2. In particular, structural changes were observed in SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding motif (RBM) due to a four-residue motif (residues 482–485: Gly-Val-Glu-Gly) which lead to a tighter contact between the SARS-CoV-2 RBM and the human ACE2. Moreover, the Phe486 of SARS-CoV-2 RBM inserts into a hydrophobic pocket of human ACE2 causing stronger contact compared to a corresponding smaller leucine residue in SARS-CoV RBM. These data have provided important structural and molecular characteristics information of SARS-CoV-2 as a basis for its enhanced binding affinity to its human ACE receptor. Taken together, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD recognizes the human ACE2 receptor better than SARS-CoV RBD does (Shang et al., 2020).\nSARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are three highly pathogenic coronaviruses which have crossed the species barrier to cause deadly pneumonia in humans (Walls et al., 2020). Similar to SARS-CoV (Artika and Ma'roef, 2017) and MERS-CoV (Xiao et al., 2018), the SARS-CoV-2 was proposed to be an airborne transmitted pathogen (Zhou et al., 2020), and therefore all possible precautions against airborne transmission in indoor scenarios should be taken (Morawska and Cao, 2020). Although the case fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2 (3.7%) (WHO, 2020) is lower compared to those of SARS-CoV (9.14%) and MERS-CoV (34.4%), it is evident that the SARS-CoV-2 is more infectious leading to very different epidemiological dynamics. Elucidation of the molecular characteristics underlying such adaptability and transmissibility in humans is therefore very important (Prompetchara et al., 2020; Zhang and Holmes, 2020). The genomic sequence data obtained from patients at the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak clearly identified the SARS-CoV-2 belongs to betacoronavirus lineage B (Sarbecovirus), within the same lineage as the SARS-CoV. Notably, the MERS-CoV falls in lineage C (Marbecovirus) (Zhang and Holmes, 2020). One of the notable molecular characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 is the presence of a polybasic cleavage site (PRRARSV) at the junction of S1 and S2 of the S protein due to four amino acid residue insertion (PRRA) at SARS-CoV-2 S positions 681–684 (Andersen et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020). This furin recognition motif permits effective cleavage by furin and other protease and determines viral infectivity and host range. The functional consequences of the polybasic cleavage site of the SARS-CoV-2 have yet to be elucidated, but may increase the virus infectivity and have impact on transmissibility and pathogenicity of the virus (Andersen et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020b; Walls et al., 2020). Surprisingly, the polybasic cleavage sites are absent in S protein of RaTG13, the bat virus closest relative of SARS-CoV-2. These cleavage sites also have not been identified in lineage B coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV, although it is found in other human betacoronaviruses such as HKU1 (lineage A). The polybasic cleavage site is a feature of the highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (Karo-karo et al., 2019; Andersen et al., 2020). In these viruses, acquisition of a polybasic cleavage site in hemagglutinin (HA) protein converts the low pathogenic avian influenza viruses into highly pathogenic viruses. The polybasic cleavage site is selected for rapid replication and transmission by avian influenza viruses (Andersen et al., 2020). In addition, there is also a proline insertion in the polybasic cleavage sites of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2. The presence of the proline residue creates a turn which is predicted to result in attachment of O-linked glycans to residues S673, T678 and S686 flanking the cleavage site. The consequences of these sets of glycosylation, which are unique to SARS-CoV-2 S protein are not known, but they may create a mucin-like domain covering epitopes or key residues of SARS-CoV-2 S protein involved in evading the host immune response (Andersen et al., 2020).\nDepending on virus strains and the availability of the host cell proteases, the S protein may be processed by one or several proteases such as furin, trypsin, cathepsin, transmembrane protease serine protease-2 (TMPRSS-2), TMPRSS-4, or human airway trypsin-like protease (HAT) to facilitate virus entry. The cleavage by type II membrane serine protease (TMPRSS) can activate fusion potential of the S protein and induce receptor-dependent formation of giant, multinucleated cells, termed syncytia. Using a lentiviral pseudotype system, Ou et al. (2020) showed that SARS-CoV-2 S protein is proteolytically activated by cathepsin L. Similar to SARS-CoV, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion was enhanced by TMPRSS 2, 4, 11A, 11D and 11E. In addition, trypsin was also found to trigger SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to induce synsytia formation. Interestingly, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 (but not SARS-CoV) was shown to induce syncytia formation without the presence of trypsin, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 S protein could be triggered upon receptor binding in the absence of exogenous protease activation (Ou et al., 2020). Similarly, Xia et al. (2020) also reported a typical phenomenon of natural syncytia formation in cells infected by SARS-CoV-2. To the contrary, SARS-CoV S protein lacked the ability to mediate the cell–cell fusion under the same conditions of cell–cell fusion system they used (Xia et al., 2020). Syncytia formation has been proposed as a strategy of coronaviruses to promote cell-cell fusion between infected and neighboring uninfected cells so as to permit direct spreading of the virus between cells, evading virus-neutralizing antibodies (Schoeman and Fielding, 2019).\nIn general, the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein-encoding regions are conserved. However, a few variations such as S194L, K249I, P344S, in the N protein of different SARS-CoV-2 strains were found (Kang et al., 2020). In addition, the codon usage pattern of SARS-CoV-2 has been analyzed by comparing its codon usage with that of other viruses of the subfamily of Orthocoronavirinae. It was found that SARS-CoV-2 has a high AU content which significantly influences its codon usage and may lead to better adaptation to the human host. Studies of evolutionary pressures which dictate codon usage of genes encoding the viral replicase, spike, envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid proteins suggested that different patterns of mutational bias and natural selection affects the codon usage of these genes. The matrix (M) and envelope (E) genes tend to evolve slowly by accumulating nucleotide mutations, while genes encoding nucleocapsid (N), viral replicase and spike proteins (S), tend to evolve relatively faster (Dilucca et al., 2020). Moreover, analysis of codon usage bias, especially in spike, envelope and main protease genes suggested that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher gene expression efficiency compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 prefers pyrimidine rich codons to purines. Most of high frequency codons end with A or T (Kandeel et al., 2020). Currently, the coding potential of SARS-CoV-2 is not fully elucidated. The presence ORF9a (internal to N), ORF3h (within ORF3a) and a putative ORF10 have been proposed (Cagliani et al., 2020).\nSince the beginning of its emergence, there has been considerable discussion regarding the origin of the virus, including whether the SARS-CoV-2 is a laboratory construct or a purposefully engineered virus (Andersen et al., 2020). Indeed, with the current advanced powerful genetic engineering techniques, a virus can be modified, redesigned, reconstructed or even synthesized. This can potentially bring about a novel virus which is unprecedented in nature (Artika and Ma'roef, 2018). The molecular characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 indicated that the virus is not a product of purposeful manipulation. For example, although the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 seems to bind with high affinity to ACE2 from humans and other animals with high receptor homology, the interaction is predicted to be not ideal. In addition, the sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD is different from that of SARS-CoV which has optimal receptor binding. This implies that the high-affinity binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to human ACE2 is most likely due to natural selection (Andersen et al., 2020). Moreover, if genetic engineering had been carried out, one of the several known genetic engineering systems available for betacoronaviruses would probably have been applied. The genetic data did not indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 is derived from any previously used virus backbone. Therefore it is hypothesized that the SARS-CoV-2 emerged through natural selection either in an animal host or directly in humans. The facts that some pangolin coronavirus RBDs show strong similarity to that of SARS-CoV-2 suggest that the S protein of the SARS-CoV-2 has undergone optimization for binding to human-like ACE2 by natural selection (Andersen et al., 2020).\nTo date, no vaccines or therapeutics are approved against any human-infecting coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2. Several options for countermeasures can be developed to control or prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections, including vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, oligonucleotide-based therapies, peptides, interferon therapies and low molecular weight drugs (Li and De Clercq, 2020). Prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, various strategies have been developed for a coronavirus vaccine which can potentially be adopted for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development. These include viral vector-based vaccines, subunit vaccines, recombinant proteins, and DNA vaccines (Enjuanes et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2020). Molecular biology techniques which have been used for development of viral countermeasures, can also be employed to develop vaccine and antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2. For example, the molecular techniques can be applied for rapid development of subunit vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 based on recombinant viral antigenic proteins. This type of vaccine type primarily contains specific viral antigenic fragments, without inclusion of any infectious viruses, therefore eliminating the concerns of incomplete inactivation, virulence recovery, or pre-existing immunity. Previous studies showed that recombinant SARS-CoV receptor binding domains (RBDs) which are stably or transiently expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, bind strongly to RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies, elicit high titer anti-SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies, and have the ability to protect most or all of the SARS-CoV-challenged mice (Wang et al., 2020b). Molecular biology techniques can also be employed in development and production of antiviral drugs such as recombinant human interferon (Wipf et al., 1994; Artika et al., 2013; Landowski et al., 2016). Recently, Mantlo et al. (2020) reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to recombinant human interferons α and β (IFNα/β). Treatment with IFN-α or IFN-β was found to significantly reduce viral titers in Vero cells. Importantly, they observed that SARS-CoV-2 is more sensitive than many other human pathogenic viruses, including SARS-CoV, to human type I interferons. These suggested that of human type I interferons have the potential efficacy in suppressing SARS-CoV-2 infection, and may be one of the potential future treatment options for COVID-19 (Mantlo et al., 2020). Recombinant human interferon can efficiently be produced in microbial cells by cloning the interferon genes into an expression vector followed by expressing the cloned genes in a host system. The interferon molecules are then purified. Microbial cells which have been used as host systems include Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bacillus subtilis, Pichia pastoris, Lactococcus lactis, Yarrowia lipolytica, and Trichoderma reesei (Wipf et al., 1994; Artika et al., 2013; Landowski et al., 2016). In general, recombinant proteins for treating diseases are mainly produced using prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression host systems such as bacteria, yeast, insect cells, mammalian cells, and transgenic plants at laboratory scale as well as in large-scale settings (Tripathi and Shrivastava, 2019).\nCoronaviruses regularly emerge and pose a major threat to both humans and animal health. The rapid global spread and the high death toll being claimed by COVID-19 clearly demonstrates that both the developed and developing nations are unprepared in controlling the latest highly-pathogenic human coronavirus emergence. Better understanding of the molecular biology of coronaviruses is critical to elucidate their emergence, origin, evolution, diversity, pathogenesis and epidemiology. Complete information of molecular characteristics of circulating coronaviruses is important for development of effective diagnostic tools to detect these viruses. Whenever new coronaviruses emerge, it is most important to have the capacity for their rapid detection in order to implement appropriate control measures and limit their spread. Detailed insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying their pathogenesis are also crucial for development of effective and safe vaccines and therapeutics. In addition, it is important to identify, at the molecular level, the biological and environmental factors which may contribute to the distribution and prevention of coronavirus diseases across populations. The highly pathogenic human coronaviruses are believed to be zoonotic. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanism which drives the cross-species transmission of coronaviruses is critical. Future studies aimed at elucidating how animal viruses cross species barriers and efficiently infect humans will help in the prevention of future zoonotic events. Continuous monitoring and analysis of genome sequences is vital to understand the genetic evolution and rates of genomic nucleotide substitution of the coronaviruses.\nAll authors listed have significantly contributed to the development and the writing of this article.\nThis research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\nNo additional information is available for this paper.\n\nCorman et al., 2018, Hung, 2003, Myint et al., 2014.</br></br>UNKNOWN URL AND TITLE</br></br>The COVID-19 outbreak emerged in 2019. The causative pathogen for COVID-19 was identified as a novel beta coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which is genetically related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV; Lu et al., 2020). Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 share the same cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), despite amino acid variation at some key residues (Chan et al., 2020). All three coronaviruses can cause severe infectious respiratory disease. Currently, COVID-19 has spread across multiple countries (Holshue et al., 2020; Hui et al., 2020), and it is reasonable to speculate that some pregnant women have been infected. However, little is known about the clinical course and the obstetric management of COVID-19 in pregnancy. Available data could be drawn from cases of pregnancy complicated with SARS and MERS. This review was conducted to investigate the clinical course and outcome of COVID-19 in pregnancy and to discuss several drugs that could be used for pregnant women with COVID-19.\nWe searched PubMed and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database for literature that was published up to March 30, 2020, using the keywords “coronavirus,” “pregnant,” or “neonate.” Data about pregnancy with COVID-19, SARS, and MERS were extracted and compared by gestational age. Table 1 shows maternal clinical characteristics, and Table 2 shows treatment and perinatal outcomes of the three coronavirus infections in pregnancy.\nTwenty-nine cases of COVID-19 during pregnancy were found in five reports (Chen H. et al., 2020; Chen S. et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). One patient was infected in the second trimester (Zhao et al., 2020), and the others in the third trimester (Chen H. et al., 2020; Chen S. et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). The pregnant woman infected in the second trimester had symptoms of fever, cough, malaise, and subsequently dyspnea. Blood counts showed lymphopenia, and computed tomography (CT) revealed diffused bilateral infiltrates in the lungs. She was given lopinavir/ritonavir, interferon α-2b, methylprednisolone, abidol, and gamma globulin successively. After 18 days of treatment, her condition improved, and virus nucleic acid testing for SARS-CoV-2 was negative twice. Thus, she continued with the pregnancy. On the other hand, the main symptoms of the other 28 patients infected in the third trimester were fever (89.3%), cough (35.7%), and myalgia (14.3%). CT images of 27 patients showed multiple patchy ground-glass shadows in the lungs. Three patients had elevated liver enzymes and nine developed fetal distress. In 17 patients who had detailed treatment data, all patients received oxygen support via a nasal cannula, 14 patients underwent antiviral therapy, and 16 patients underwent antibiotic treatment. As a result, 26 patients delivered via cesarean section and two patients via vaginal delivery. All neonates survived except for one. It should be noted that in the study by Zhu et al. some neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 had adverse neonatal outcomes such as premature labor, respiratory distress, thrombocytopenia accompanied by abnormal liver function, and even death (Zhu et al., 2020).\nWith regard to SARS, 19 cases have been reported during pregnancy (Zhang et al., 2003; Robertson et al., 2004; Wong et al., 2004; Yudin et al., 2005). Seven patients became infected in the first trimester, five patients in the second trimester, and seven patients in the third trimester. The most common symptoms of infected pregnant women included fever (100%), cough (78.9%), and myalgia (68.4%). Lymphocytopenia was observed in 15 pregnant women, and chest radiographs of all pregnant women indicated viral infection in the lungs. Twelve pregnant women were given antiviral drugs, 14 pregnant women were given antibiotic drugs, and 12 pregnant women were given corticosteroids. Spontaneous miscarriage was observed in four out of seven patients who were infected in the first trimester. Three of the 19 pregnant women died; however, all the neonates who were delivered in the second or third trimester survived. Two cases suffered from fetal growth restriction and oligohydramnios, four cases developed fetal distress, and there was one case of spontaneous preterm birth.\nEleven cases of pregnancy with MERS were reported (Payne et al., 2014; Alserehi et al., 2016; Assiri et al., 2016; Malik et al., 2016; Park et al., 2016; Alfaraj et al., 2019). One patient was infected in the first trimester, five patients in the second trimester, and six patients in the third trimester. Most pregnant women presented with dyspnea (72.7%), cough (63.6%), and fever (54.5%); their chest radiographs revealed typical signs of viral infection. Unfortunately, there were no detailed treatment-related data. The woman infected in the first trimester continued pregnancy after her virus nucleic acid testing for MERS-Cov turned negative. Two patients had stillbirths, and one patient developed placental abruption. Three pregnant women and three neonates died.\nThe diagnosis of COVID-19 in pregnancy is mainly based on epidemiological history, clinical manifestations, chest radiography, and etiological tests (National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, 2020). This is similar to the evidence of diagnosis for SARS and MERS in pregnancy. According to our literature review, most pregnant women infected by the three coronaviruses had an epidemiological contact history. Fever, cough, myalgia, and dyspnea are the major symptoms. CT images revealed typical signs of viral infection in the lungs. Nasopharynx swab or sputum was positive in the virus nucleic acid test. Lymphopenia and elevated liver enzymes were commonly seen in pregnant women with COVID-19 and SARS.\nAccording to the seventh guidelines published by the National Health Commission of China, the treatment of COVID-19 mainly involves oxygen therapy, antiviral therapy, and supportive treatment (National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, 2020). At present, there is no antiviral drug for the treatment of COVID-19; therefore, identifying an antiviral drug against COVID-19 in pregnancy is imperative.\nInterferon-alpha is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that activates antiviral protein genes and modulates immune cell function (Totura and Bavari, 2019). For SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, interferon-alpha was effective at reducing viral replication in vitro and in vivo (Cinatl et al., 2003; Falzarano et al., 2013a,b). Regarding its safe use in pregnant women, one systematic review suggested that interferon-alpha does not significantly increase the risk of adverse perinatal outcomes above general population rates (Yazdani Brojeni et al., 2012).\nLopinavir/ritonavir is a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitor that was found to target the SARS-CoV-1 nonstructural protein 3CLpro in vitro (Lu, 2020). During the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic, lopinavir/ritonavir combined with ribavirin reduced the viral load and decreased the rate of death or ARDS (Chu et al., 2004). Lopinavir/ritonavir also increased the viral clearance rate and survival rate in patients with MERS (Chan et al., 2015). Lopinavir/ritonavir was also administered to pregnant women with HIV. It was found that HIV proliferation was effectively suppressed during pregnancy and through 1 year postpartum (Cohan et al., 2015). Furthermore, the rate of preterm deliveries, low-birth-weight neonates, stillbirths, and birth defects did not increase (Roberts et al., 2009; Cohan et al., 2015).\nIn addition, ribavirin and favipiravir are representative of a guanosine analog. Mechanically, ribavirin and favipiravir can inhibit virus RNA synthesis by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and inhibit mRNA capping (Totura and Bavari, 2019). In the previous literature, ribavirin was administered to pregnant women with SARS. However, it was found that ribavirin at the concentration of typical human regimens could not significantly inhibit coronavirus replication in vitro (Shen et al., 2016). Furthermore, meta-analyses have found that its role was limited in the treatment of coronavirus-related respiratory syndromes (Stockman et al., 2006; Morra et al., 2018). The resistance might be explained by nsp14 exoribonuclease being expressed by coronavirus. As nsp14 exoribonuclease can function as an excision nucleoside analog due to its proofreading activity (Minskaia et al., 2006), it is speculated that COVID-19 might also be resistant to ribavirin or favipiravir (Chan et al., 2020).\nIn contrast, remdesivir, a nucleoside analog, could act against both SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV in vitro (Sheahan et al., 2017). In vivo, remdesivir was more effective than lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon-β in decreasing the viral load of mice infected with MERS-CoV (Sheahan et al., 2020). The mechanism involved is that it can interfere with the nsp12 polymerase even in the setting of nsp14 exoribonuclease proofreading activity (Agostini et al., 2018). As expected, remdesivir was proved to be effective in the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro (Wang et al., 2020a). However, data about its safety during pregnancy are absent.\nInitially, chloroquine was used as an antimalarial drug. It was later found to act against SARS-CoV-1 in primate cells either before or after exposure to the virus (Vincent et al., 2005). Recently, chloroquine was found to inhibit the proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro (Wang et al., 2020a). The mechanism involved might be that it interferes with terminal glycosylation of ACE2 (Vincent et al., 2005). As to its safety in pregnancy, chloroquine was not shown to be associated with birth weight, gestational age, growth, or development of newborns, neurological development, and visual acuity in infants in the previous literature (Villegas et al., 2007; Ward et al., 2007; Divala et al., 2018).\nArbidol, which is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug whose mechanism involves inhibition of enveloped virus membrane fusion, has also been used (Blaising et al., 2014). Arbidol and arbidol mesylate were effective in suppressing the proliferation of SARS-CoV-1 in vitro (Khamitov et al., 2008). Furthermore, arbidol was effective against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro (Wang et al., 2020b). In Russia, arbidol was administered to pregnant women with influenza (Bulgakova et al., 2017). In our the studies included in our literature review, arbidol was found to have been administered to pregnant women with COVID-19 (Yu et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020). However, its safety in pregnancy requires further research.\nIn summary, interferon-alpha, lopinavir/ritonavir, and chloroquine could be administered to pregnant women with COVID-19 after patients were fully informed of these <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightgreen; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">drugs<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">usages</span>\n</mark> ' benefits and risks. <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightorange; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">Remdesivir<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">chemical</span>\n</mark> and arbidol are <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightblue; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">promising<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">ideas</span>\n</mark>  <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightgreen; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">antiviral<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">usages</span>\n</mark>  <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightgreen; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">drugs<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">usages</span>\n</mark>  <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightgreen; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">against<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">usages</span>\n</mark> COVID-19; however, their safety in pregnancy requires further research. In addition, antibiotics and corticosteroids are recommended in pregnancy with COVID-19 if necessary (Mer and Richards, 1998; Wong et al., 2003). However, antibiotics should not be used without indication, and high doses of glucocorticoids should be avoided as much as possible (National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, 2020).\nDue to impaired cellular immunity and physiological changes, mild pneumonia is more likely to develop into severe pneumonia in pregnant women, and severe pneumonia is deleterious for the fetus (Lam et al., 2004; Goodnight and Soper, 2005). Thus, timely pregnancy termination may be beneficial for both mothers and infants if the disease advances. As to the mode of pregnancy termination, cesarean section is recommended (National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, 2020). However, if the pregnant woman's condition does not worsen, there is a chance of having a healthy baby if pregnancy is continued. In the previous literature, pregnant women with SARS or MERS who continued pregnancy after their etiological test turned negative had favorable maternal and neonatal outcomes. However, some of them had suffered intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), meconium-stained amniotic fluid, or fetal distress.\nPathological examination of placentas from women with COVID-19 showed various degrees of fibrin deposition inside and around the villi with local syncytial nodules, concomitant with the morphology of chorionic hemangioma or massive placental infarction (Chen S. et al., 2020). Further, the results from SARS-related pregnancies revealed increased intervillous, subchorionic fibrin, or extensive fetal thrombotic vasculopathy (Ng et al., 2006). It was speculated that these placental pathological morphological changes were caused by hypoxia during coronavirus infection, and they may result in IUGR, meconium-stained amniotic fluid, or fetal distress. Similarly, miscarriage and stillbirth could also result from hypoxia caused by coronavirus infection. Therefore, pregnant women with COVID-19 should be closely monitored, even after their nucleic acid test for SARS-Cov-2 turns negative.\nIn the studies included in our literature review, all pregnant women with COVID-19 and their neonates survived except for one neonate (Zhu et al., 2020). However, several pregnant women with SARS or MERS died or had a stillbirth, and some neonates failed to survive. It is speculated that COVID-19 during pregnancy might be less severe than SARS or MERS during pregnancy. This is consistent with the conclusion that the mortality rate of COVID-19 is less than that of SARS or MERS (Han et al., 2020; Liao et al., 2020).\nAmniotic fluid, cord blood, placenta, and the fetal membrane from pregnant women with COVID-19, SARS, and MERS were all negative when tested with a viral nucleic acid test for SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and MERS-CoV, respectively, in the studies included in our literature review. This could be partly explained by the different distribution of their cellular receptors. The ACE2 protein is mainly expressed on lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine (Hamming et al., 2004). However, ACE2 mRNA expression was found to be low in cells from the early maternal-fetal interface with single-cell RNA-sequencing technology. Hence, it is speculated that the ratio of SARS-CoV-2-infected mother-to-fetus transmission will be relatively low (Zheng et al., 2020). Even if SARS-CoV-2 could not transmit from mothers to babies, it could be transmitted by close contact because coronavirus also exists in the sweat glands and the distal convoluted tubules of the kidney in addition to the intestinal and respiratory tracts (To and Lo, 2004; Zhou et al., 2017). Therefore, the neonates of pregnant women with COVID-19 should be isolated for at least 14 days and should not be breastfed (National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, 2020).\nThis research has provided some strategies for the obstetric management of pregnant women with COVID-19. To some extent, clinical characteristics were similar among pregnancies with COVID-19, SARS, and MERS. It seems that COVID-19 during pregnancy is milder than SARS and MERS during pregnancy. However, pregnant women with COVID-19 should be closely monitored, even after their etiological tests turn negative. Maternal separation is necessary even if there was no vertical transmission. Interferon-alpha, lopinavir-ritonavir, and chloroquine could be good candidates for the treatment of COVID-19 during pregnancy, but more work is needed to explore their effectiveness and safety. In addition, remdesivir and arbidol, which are potential drug treatments for COVID-19, require further research on their safety during pregnancy.\nYL and DL provided the concept.

According to statistics, the average duration from onset of symptoms to hospital discharge of COVID-19 patients is about 24.7 days, with a crude case fatality ratio of 3.67%, which poses a severe threat to human public health.1 Although COVID-19 mainly causes respiratory failure, an increasing number of extrapulmonary organ dysfunction cases have been reported, especially in critically ill patients.2 About 14–53% of patients have presented elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) at varying degrees during COVID-19,3 suggesting that liver injury may be a common extrapulmonary manifestation of COVID-19. In this work, we reviewed the current research progress of abnormal liver enzymes in COVID-19, which may deepen our understanding of its characteristics and pathogenesis, ultimately providing help for future studies.\nAt present, there is no unified standard for the definition of COVID-19-related liver injury. The China Digestion Association and the Chinese Society of Hepatology published a standard depending on the upper limit of normal (ULN) of liver enzymes. In this protocol, COVID-19-related liver injury is defined as a significant abnormality in liver biochemical test during the occurrence, development and treatment of COVID-19, namely ALT or AST >3 ULN, or total bilirubin (TBIL) >2 ULN, regardless of whether there has been any underlying liver disease in the past.4 The patterns of liver injury in COVID-19 were classified as three types:5 hepatocellular, if ALT and/or AST >3 ULN; cholestatic, if alkaline phosphatase (ALP) or gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) >2 ULN; and mixed type, if patients have both laboratory abnormalities. Some studies have used other standard definitions of ALT cut-offs. In these studies, liver injury was categorized into the following three grades based on ALT values: mild, if the ALT value was between 1 and 2 ULN; moderate, if between 2 and 5 ULN; and severe, if >5 ULN.6\nALT is a more specific marker for liver injury than AST, due to the more predominant extra-hepatic sources of AST, rendering it less liver-specific.6,7 However, the serum activity of AST may be a more sensitive indicator of liver injury in conditions such as acute hepatic ischemia, alcohol-related liver disease, and some cases of autoimmune hepatitis.7–10 It is still unknown how SARS-CoV-2 impacts the liver. Liver biochemical abnormalities in COVID-19 can be caused by acute hepatic ischemia, hypoxia, aggravation of the primary liver disease, and drug-induced liver injury (DILI). Thus, the definition of liver injury by ALT cut-offs is incomplete or rigorous due to the variable patterns of liver enzyme abnormalities. Actually, it is recommended that the best discriminant values for recognizing acute liver injury are 200 U/L for AST and 300 U/L for ALT.11 Nevertheless, due to the multifactorial reasons for abnormal liver enzymes in the clinical settings, the definition of COVID-19-related liver injury needs to be further explored.\nFor demographic characteristics, recent research studies have shown that male sex and increased age are associated with abnormal liver enzymes in COVID-19.\nIn the initial studies characterizing COVID-19 patients, male sex was one of the common factors associated with abnormal liver enzymes.5,12,13 In a study, the ratio of males to females was 4:1 for patients with liver injury.14 Li et al.15 found that male sex correlated with elevated ALT and AST levels (p=0.027 and 0.036, respectively). Notably, male sex has been reported to associate with hospital admission.16 Previous research found an increased male susceptibility to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) mediated by differences in estrogen receptor signalling,17 so it is worth further exploring whether sex-specific differences also exist in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, sex has been shown to influence ALT activity,18 as men tend to have a higher serum ALT activity than women.7 This may explain the higher percentage of males in COVID-19-related liver injury.\nFurther studies showed that age, male sex and body mass index (commonly known as BMI) were predictors of peak hospitalization in patients with abnormal liver enzymes >5 ULN.5,19 However, in another study, although advanced age was associated with poor prognosis, multivariate analysis found that younger age was one of the most effective predictors of severe liver injury (ALT >5 ULN).6 This contradiction may be explained by the overactive immune and inflammatory response to COVID-19 in young patients.\nAdditionally, it has been reported that the prevalence of abnormal liver enzymes in the USA-based cohorts is considerably higher than that in Chinese cohorts.20,21 The prevalence of ALT and AST elevations in Chinese cohorts ranged between 4–33% and 4–53% respectively, while the elevated admission ALT and AST were up to 39.0% and 58.4% in a large New York, USA cohort.20–22 Higher BMI and metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) prevalence in the USA may explain some of the discrepancies with Chinese cohorts.20,21,23\nIncreased ALT and AST levels were the most common abnormality found among the liver enzymes in COVID-19. Most patients presented mild to moderate elevation, rarely with more than 10 ULN abnormalities. The increase of GGT and TBIL were relatively common, while ALP level was usually not increased. In addition, inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), serum ferritin (SF) and interleukin (IL)-6, have tended to show an increase that is more obvious in COVID-19-related liver injury patients.5,12,14,20,24–26\nA study that included 417 COVID-19 cases showed that a total of 318 patients had abnormal liver enzymes, of which more than 90% showed mild (<2 ULN) at admission; patients with elevated ALT, AST, GGT, and TBIL levels exceeding 3 ULN during hospitalization accounted for 10.4%, 5.7%, 11.6%, and 2.8%, while ALP level did not increase significantly.5 Further studies determined the dynamic changes of the patterns of liver enzymes in COVID-19-related liver injury.12,14,20 The study by Lei et al.12 showed that in severe patients, AST was significantly elevated first at admission, followed by ALT elevation, and the fluctuation of TBIL and ALP levels was relatively slight. Further analysis found that the above elevated biochemical indexes were significantly associated with adverse outcomes of COVID-19, among which AST was associated with the highest mortality risk.12 Similar results were shown by other studies,14,20,26 and correlation analysis found that AST highly correlated with ALT throughout the illness course.\nNotably, abnormal liver enzymes could also associate with systemic involvement of COVID-19. The study conducted by Bloom et al.20 showed that AST had mild to moderate correlation with creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), CRP, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and SF. Piano et al.26 also found that patients with abnormal liver enzymes had a more severe systemic inflammation, suggesting collateral hepatic damage from systemic inflammation driven by COVID-19. Of note, some studies proposed that elevated AST in COVID-19 presented more like a cytotoxicity response rather than liver damage, which may potentially involve the muscles.27,28 Other studies found that AST was strongly correlated with ALT throughout the illness course and to a less extent with CK, reasonably suggesting that liver injury was the predominant source of aminotransferase elevation.12,14,20,26\nXie et al.29 used computed tomography (CT) scores to analyze the relationship between chest CT manifestations and liver injury in patients with COVID-19, and the results showed that the CT scores in the liver injury group were significantly higher than those in the non-liver injury group (p<0.05); the incidence of liver injury in patients with CT scores <5, 5–15 and >15 were 13.3%, 36.4% and 77.8%, respectively; further analysis showed that CT score was an independent predictor of liver injury. Another study found that patients with abnormal liver enzymes had more frequent bilateral consolidation at chest X-ray than those without (44% vs. 32%; p=0.006).26 Pulmonary imaging findings could accurately reflect the progression of COVID-19. Although the causal relationship between pulmonary CT findings and liver injury was not clear, CT score, as an independent predictor of liver injury, suggested that liver injury may be associated with disease severity. Therefore, for patients with severe pulmonary imaging manifestations, liver function should also be monitored when treating respiratory diseases.\nFurthermore, Bhayana et al.30 found that bowel abnormalities and cholestasis were common findings on abdominal imaging of patients with COVID-19. Among right upper quadrant ultrasounds, 87% (32 out of 37) were performed due to liver laboratory findings in intensive care unit (ICU) patients, and 54% (20 out of 37) demonstrated a dilated sludge-filled gallbladder which suggested cholestasis. Although the basic disease status of patients with cholestasis had not been analyzed, this research showed that not only the abnormal liver enzymes but also the cholestasis could be present in COVID-19 patients. Indeed, based on limited evidence, the prevalence of cholestatic type has ranged from 24% to 29.25% in COVID-19 patients with abnormal liver enzymes,5,26 and whether these patients have radiologically detectable cholestasis is worth further exploration. Notably, cholestasis could lead to severe liver damage if not effectively controlled, so it is necessary to provide timely and effective treatment for patients with cholestasis.\nAt present, reports of the liver histopathological features of COVID-19 patients are limited. Previous studies have found that moderate microvesicular steatosis and mild periportal lymphocytic inflammation were the most frequent pathological findings in the liver of COVID-19 patients, indicating that either SARS-CoV-2 infection or DILI could cause the injury.5,31–34 Elsoukkary et al.35 observed peculiar basophilic structures of unknown origin in sinusoidal endothelium in 36% of COVID-19 patients. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in liver tissue by polymerase chain reaction.32,34 Lagana et al.36 analyzed the hepatic findings in autopsy specimens from 40 patients who died of COVID-19 complications. The results showed that macrovesicular steatosis was the most common finding (75%), followed by lobular necroinflammation (50%), portal inflammation (50%) and cholestasis (38%). Furthermore, a recent study showed that a large number of apoptotic hepatocytes and prominent binuclear hepatocytes were found in liver autopsies of two COVID-19 patients.37 Although no obvious viral inclusion bodies were found, transmission electron microscopy examination revealed that hepatocyte cytoplasm contained a large number of typical coronavirus particles with spike structure.37 In addition, obvious virus invasion manifestations, such as mitochondrial swelling, endoplasmic reticulum dilatation and impaired cell membrane, were also found, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect hepatocytes and lead to liver injury.37\nAt present, a large number of studies have shown that liver biochemical abnormalities are more prevalent in severe patients. Guan et al.38 collected 1,099 COVID-19 cases from 552 hospitals in China, and found that the incidence of elevated AST, ALT, and TBIL levels in severe patients were significantly higher than those in non-severe patients (AST: 39.4% vs. 18.2%; ALT: 28.1% vs. 19.8%; TBIL: 13.3% vs. 9.9%;). Among 82 hospitalized patients who died of COVID-19 in Wuhan, 78% had liver injury, and further analysis showed that AST (p=0.002) and ALT (p=0.037) were significantly correlated with the time from initial symptom onset to death.39 Furthermore, a study involving 1,590 COVID-19 cases showed that patients with elevated AST, ALT and TBIL levels at admission had case fatality rate of 68.6%, 54.3% and 39% respectively, suggesting that abnormal liver enzymes may be related to poor prognosis.40 In another large cohort study, the clinical course of 145 patients with severe liver injury (ALT >5 ULN) was worse, including higher rates of ICU admission (69%), intubation (65%), renal replacement therapy (33%), and mortality (42%).6 Therefore, the severity of COVID-19 is closely related to liver injury, which may predict adverse clinical outcomes.\nRecently, with the increase of clinical data, the relationship between liver injury and the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 is being explored further. Ponziani et al.41 found that baseline of liver enzyme abnormality was associated with increased risk of ICU admission (odds ratio: 2.19 [95% confidence interval: 1.24–3.89], p=0.007) but not with mortality (odds ratio: 0.84 [95% confidence interval: 0.49–1.41], p=0.51), and it tended to normalize over time. However, more studies have shown that liver enzyme abnormality is an independent predictor of poor prognosis for COVID-19 patients.26,42,43 Yip et al.42 found that the incidence of elevated ALT/AST levels and acute liver injury were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients who developed adverse clinical outcomes (including ICU admission, use of invasive mechanical ventilation and/or death) than in those who did not (ALT/AST elevation: 70.9% vs. 19.1%, p<0.001; acute liver injury: 14.5% vs. 0.9%, p<0.001); multivariate analysis showed that ALT/AST elevation and acute liver injury were independently associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Similarly, the study by Piano et al.26 showed that liver enzyme abnormality was an independent predictor of transfer to ICU or death. Therefore, according to current evidence, it is necessary to regularly monitor the liver function of COVID-19 patients.\nSevere COVID-19 is not common among children. The Chinese Center for Disease  Control and Prevention survey of 72,314 cases of COVID-19 confirmed that the proportion of children under 10 years of age was less than 1%, most children presented with mild symptoms or asymptomatic infection.44 A study of 171 children with SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to Wuhan Children’s Hospital showed that the incidence of elevated ALT and AST were 12.1% and 14.6%.45 Wang et al.46 analyzed 31 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children from six provinces in northern China and found that 22.2% of them had elevated transaminases, with the peak values of ALT and AST levels being 68 U/L and 67 U/L, respectively. Due to the rare occurrence of liver enzyme abnormalities in children with COVID-19, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases warns that COVID-19 children with elevated AST or ALT should be fully evaluated for potential liver disease and other infections.47 Notably, Cui et al.48 reported a female infant case presented with pneumonia, liver injury and heart damage after infection with SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that children with COVID-19 may also suffer from multiple organ damage and rapid disease changes.\nCLD poses a major public health burden. Patients with  CLD, especially those with advanced liver diseases, such as cirrhosis and liver cancer, may be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to dysregulated innate and acquired immunity.49,50 Thus, the effects of different basic liver conditions on COVID-19-related liver injury need to be meticulously evaluated.3 According to existing reports, the proportion of CLD patients was low in COVID-19 cases. A large-scale meta-analysis showed that the pooled prevalence of underlying CLD among COVID-19 patients and critically ill patients were 3.6% and 3.9%, respectively.51 Similar to the clinical features of ordinary COVID-19 patients, the liver injury in COVID-19 patients with CLD is also correlated with the severity of disease and poor prognosis. A study involving 105 SARS-CoV-2 and chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) co-infected patients showed that abnormal liver enzymes of those patients were relatively common at admission and significantly elevated during hospitalization, of which 14 patients (13.33%) developed liver injury, being more common in men (p=0.001); patients with liver injury had a higher proportion of severe cases, complications rate, and mortality (all p<0.05).52\nNotably, the interaction between COVID-19 and pre-existing CLD could cause liver injury and aggravate the course of these two diseases.53–55 A study collected clinical data of 228 COVID-19 patients with CLD from 13 Asian countries, and found that among COVID-19 patients with CLD, 43% of CLD patients without cirrhosis developed acute liver damage, 20% of patients with compensated cirrhosis developed acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) (11.6%) or acute decompensation (9.1%), 57% of patients with decompensated cirrhosis showed progressive aggravation of liver injury, and the mortality was as high as 43%.53 The cases of ACLF secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection have also been reported.53,54,56,57 In addition, Iavarone et al.54 found that mortality was significantly higher in COVID-19 patients with cirrhosis than in COVID-19 patients without cirrhosis (34% vs. 18%; p=0.035) and cirrhotic patients hospitalized for bacterial infections (34% vs. 17%; p=0.03). Similarly, a study including 2,780 COVID-19 patients found that patients with CLD were at an increased risk for mortality (relative risk: 2.8; 95% confidence interval: 1.9–4.0; p<0.001) compared to patients without CLD, and the relative risk was markedly higher in patients with cirrhosis (relative risk: 4.6; 95% confidence interval: 2.6–8.3; p<0.001).55 The above studies suggest that COVID-19 can increase the liver burden of CLD patients and worsen the prognosis for patients with poor liver reserve capacity, and vice versa. Therefore, in order to avoid adverse clinical outcomes due to impaired liver reserve capacity, it is necessary to carry out risk stratification and personalization of the management for COVID-19 patients with CLD.\nWander et al.58 first reported a COVID-19 case with acute hepatitis as the initial manifestation, suggesting that liver could also be the target organ of SARS-CoV-2 infection. With the increasing studies of hepatic pathology in COVID-19, recently published data has indicated SARS-CoV-2 RNA and typical coronavirus particles in liver tissue,36,37 which suggests that SARS-CoV-2 could directly infect hepatocytes. As the cellular receptor of SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is mainly expressed in bile duct epithelial cells rather than liver tissue; thus, the route of SARS-CoV-2 infection to hepatocytes is not clear. In a mouse model of acute liver injury with partial hepatectomy established by Guan et al.,59 the up-regulated expression of ACE2 mRNA after liver injury corresponds to the elevation of AST and ALT, suggesting that ACE2 expression in bile duct epithelial cells might be involved in the liver repair process, while those newborn hepatocytes might still maintain the characteristics of expressing ACE2, making them susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. Attention should also be paid to the non-ACE2-dependent manner of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The antibody-dependent enhancement (referred to as ADE) of virus infection is a phenomenon that virus-specific antibodies can enhance the replication and infection ability of the virus to enter monocytes/macrophages and granulocytes by interacting with Fc receptors and/or complement receptors.60 A study showed that anti-SARS-CoV spike protein antibody can trigger ADE and mediate SARS-CoV entrance into immune cells that do not express ACE2.61 Therefore, it is worth considering whether ADE can also mediate SARS-CoV-2’s infection in hepatocytes in a non-ACE2-dependent manner and then cause liver damage. In addition, a study showed that hypoxia can induce an increase of ACE2 expression in human hepatocytes.62 Since patients with COVID-19 often suffer from different degrees of hypoxia and systemic inflammatory reactions, hepatocytes may increase their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 through up-regulation of ACE2 expression under hypoxia conditions.\nLaboratory examination of COVID-19 patients has mainly showed a decrease of lymphocytes, an increase of infection-related markers (including PCT, ESR, SF, and CRP) and inflammatory cytokines (including tumor necrosis factor-α [TNF-α], IL-2 receptor [IL-2R], and IL-6). These biochemical indicators were significantly increased in severe cases, which can lead to aggravation of inflammatory reactions and generation of cytokine storms.63 Cytokine storm is the excessive activation of the immune system caused by infection, drugs, or certain diseases. It involves the continuous activation and proliferation of various lymphocytes and macrophages, and leads to a rapid and large secretion of various cytokines, including TNF-α, interferons (INFs, including INF-α, INF-β, INF-γ), IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, finally causing serious damage to vital organs through the inflammatory cascade reaction.64 Similar to SARS, cytokine storm is a characteristic manifestation in critically ill COVID-19 patients, which is also the main cause of disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multiple organ failure.65 Phipps et al.6 found that in COVID-19 patients, severe liver injury was associated with markers of end-organ dysfunction, including peak levels of high-sensitivity troponin, CK, and serum creatinine, as well as inflammatory markers, including peak PCT, CRP, D-dimer, SF and IL-6 levels (all p<0.001), suggesting that liver injury may be related to the inflammatory response and cytokine storm.6 In addition, compared with ALT, elevated AST level seems to be more common in COVID-19 patients with liver injury and is closely related to poor prognosis. AST is widely distributed in various organs, such as liver, heart muscle, skeletal muscle, kidney, etc. Lei et al.12 found that AST elevation was positively correlated with lymphocyte reduction and neutrophil elevation in COVID-19 patients, and the latter was a reliable indicator of disease severity, suggesting that multi-organ damage caused by cytokine storms may contribute to AST level abnormality.\nHypoxic hepatitis (HH), which is also known as ischemic hepatitis and shock liver, refers to reversible central necrosis of the hepatic lobule caused by severe hypotension and hypoxemia. It is characterized by sharp and transient elevation of serum transaminase, which usually reaches a peak level within 24 h (>20 ULN) and returns to normal within 1–2 weeks. HH is caused by many factors, with heart failure (39–70%) being the main cause, followed by septic shock (32%), septicemia (23%) and respiratory failure (15%).66 Severe heart failure can cause liver congestion. The release of inflammatory mediators and endotoxin during septic shock may reduce the oxygen uptake ability of hepatocytes. When the above conditions are combined with oxidative stress induced by tissue ischemia-reperfusion, HH is more likely to occur.66–68 A cohort study of 191 COVID-19 cases in Wuhan showed that the most common complication of COVID-19 patients was sepsis (59%), followed by respiratory failure (54%), acute respiratory distress syndrome (31%), heart failure (23%) and septic shock (20%).69 Moreover, most COVID-19 patients have different degrees of hypoxemia and more than 40% of them need oxygen therapy.38 The above complications are all risk factors for HH, indicating that COVID-19 patients may have a high risk of HH. In addition, in liver autopsy of a patient who died of COVID-19, a few hepatocytes with slight vesicular steatosis and watery degeneration as well as inflammatory cells were observed, which was considered to have been caused by hypoxia and ischemia-reperfusion.5 Therefore, from the perspective of pathophysiology and histology, ischemia and hypoxia may be one of the pathogeneses of COVID-19-related liver injury. It should be noted that in the current reports of COVID-19-related liver injury, most cases present with mild to moderate elevation of liver enzymes, while cases of significant liver enzyme elevation (>10 ULN) are still uncommon. Therefore, further studies are needed to clarify HH as a possible mechanism to liver injury in COVID-19.\nCurrently, there are no specific antiviral drugs for COVID-19. Interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, chloroquine phosphate and traditional Chinese medicine are the main drugs for antiviral treatment.70 It has been reported that more than 50% of COVID-19 patients received antibiotic treatment during hospitalization.38 In addition, it is relatively common for fever patients to take antipyretic-analgesics before admission. As the main component of antipyretic-analgesics, acetaminophen is the primary cause of acute liver failure in occident.71 Of note, the above drugs have been reported to associate with abnormal liver enzymes in COVID-19 patients.12,25,26,42,72 Piano et al.26 found that de novo abnormalities of liver enzymes were more common in COVID-19 patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir (64% vs. 48%, p=0.045), acetaminophen (63% vs. 47%, p=0.048), piperacillin/tazobactam (72% vs. 50%, p=0.013) and tocilizumab (82% vs. 52%, p=0.009). Another study showed that the use of lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, interferon-beta and corticosteroids was independently associated with ALT/AST elevation in COVID-19 patients.42 Falcão et al.72 reported a significant liver enzyme elevation (∼10 ULN) in a COVID-19 patient after using hydroxychloroquine, suggesting that hydroxychloroquine may have hepatotoxicity. Lopinavir/ritonavir is mainly metabolized by liver, and Fan et al.25 found that the proportion of patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir was significantly higher in the group with liver injury than the group without (57.8% vs. 31.3%, p=0.01), suggesting that liver injury <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightblue; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">may<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">ideas</span>\n</mark> be related to the <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightgreen; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">use<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">usages</span>\n</mark> of lopinavir/ritonavir.\n <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightorange; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">Remdesivir<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">chemical</span>\n</mark> has been <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightpink; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">reported<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">trials</span>\n</mark> to cause a significant increase in serum transaminase after usage in COVID-19 patients.73,74 In a study, after remdesivir treatment, marked ALT/AST elevations and life-threatening elevations were observed in 6% and 2% of COVID-19 patients, respectively.75 Furthermore, a pharmacovigilance analysis performed using VigiBase to summarize hepatic impairment showed that with remdesivir, increased liver enzymes were the most frequent adverse drug reactions (114, 88%), involving ALT/AST in 79 cases (61%) and bilirubin in 4 cases (3%).76 According to Leegwater et al.,77 who reported that one severe COVID-19 patient experienced an acute increase in ALT (1,305 IU/L) and AST (1,461 U/L) levels after receiving remdesivir treatment, and the interaction between P-glycoprotein inhibitors chloroquine and remdesivir had been considered to cause this acute toxic liver injury.\nMuhović et al.78 described the first case of a severe COVID-19 patient who developed DILI associated with the use of tocilizumab, marked by a 40-fold increase in transaminases levels. Notably, in this research, the diagnosis of DILI induced by tocilizumab was based on the Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM). RUCAM is appreciated as a structured, standardized, validated, and liver-specific diagnostic approach that attributes scores to individual key items, providing final quantitative causality grading for each suspect drug/herb in a case report.79 In brief, RUCAM quantifies the strength of association between a liver injury and the medication implicated as the cause of the injury, so it is recommended for assessing DILI cases.80,81 In practice, DILI commonly stands for the idiosyncratic DILI (iDILI) which lacks clear dose dependency and is caused by unpredictable events due to immunologic or metabolic drug reactions.82 However, at present, not many studies have used RUCAM to evaluate iDILI in COVID-19. Considering the use of pharmacotherapy for COVID-19 may reflect disease severity, the diagnosis of iDILI in COVID-19 may be confounded. Thus, using the updated RUCAM to verify causality in suspected iDILI cases is necessary.\nCOVID-19 patients, especially critically ill patients, often need to take multiple drugs combined with therapy, which is more likely to increase the risk of DILI under the condition of systemic immune disorder. Therefore, the use of medicine should be rational to reduce the chance of DILI in clinical practice.\nExisting research has shown that COVID-19 patients with underlying liver disease have a higher risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 and could exacerbate original liver disease.53,54 There are multiple reports of COVID-19 patients complicated with ACLF, emphasizing the influence of several factors on basic liver diseases during the course of COVID-19. Hepatitis B patients who are receiving antiviral therapy may have hepatitis attacks if they stop using anti-HBV drugs during the period of COVID-19. For those who have not received anti-HBV therapy, receiving high-dose hormone therapy may lead to hepatitis B virus reactivation (referred to herein as HBVr).4 Therefore, as the American Gastroenterological Association recommends, antiviral prophylaxis should be provided for patients with high and moderate risk of HBVr treated with immunosuppressive drugs, while routine antiviral prophylaxis in patients with low risk of HBVr should be carefully considered.83 In addition, attention should be paid to the potential impact of MAFLD on COVID-19-related liver injury. MAFLD is associated with extra-hepatic manifestations of metabolic syndrome. As an important immune organ of the human body, the liver contains a large number of macrophages. MAFLD patients usually have different levels of elevated inflammatory cytokines and SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to immune stress; as such, it may accelerate the progression of MAFLD and lead to liver injury.84\nThe pathogenesis of COVID-19-related liver injury has not been clarified at present. In addition to the possible pathogenesis mentioned above, some scholars have also proposed the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 directly acts on hepatocytes or activates Kupffer cells through the “intestine-liver” axis after intestinal infection, and thus leads to liver injury.85 In addition, some scholars believe that mechanical ventilation increases the positive end-expiratory pressure of the patient, causing an increase in right atrial pressure and obstructing venous return, thus leading to liver congestion, which may be one of the mechanisms of liver injury in COVID-19.86 However, no research has confirmed the above views so far. Notably, the pathological changes of COVID-19-related liver injury are complex and diverse, which may be involved in a variety of pathogenesis factors, and therefore more related research is needed to explore its mechanism.\nAt present, antiviral treatment for COVID-19 remains investigational, while etiological treatment is limited. Thus, for patients with COVID-19-related liver injury, the current therapy is mainly supportive treatment based on the severity of liver injury. Mild liver biochemical abnormalities in COVID-19 patients are usually transient and can recover without special treatment. However, for patients with acute severe liver injury, the probable causes of injury should be fully considered, including a history of preexisting liver disease, exposure to hepatotoxins, hypoxia, and circulation status. Meanwhile, liver biochemical indicators should also be closely monitored to prevent the occurrence of acute liver failure. Respiratory and circulatory support should be strengthened in patients with hypoxic hepatitis. For patients with suspected DILI, discontinuation or reduction of the use of suspected drugs should be considered.4 As for patients with underlying liver disease, liver-protecting drugs should be given appropriately, and the combination of immunosuppressive drugs and antiviral therapy in those with viral hepatitis should be carefully considered. For liver transplant patients, although studies showed that reducing immunosuppressive agents did not increase the risk of mortality, the application of immunosuppressant should still be weighed.87\nIn conclusion, the overall incidence of abnormal liver enzymes is high in COVID-19 patients, especially in severe cases, and is associated with poor prognosis. Advanced age, male sex and high BMI are the predictors of abnormal liver enzymes in COVID-19. Pediatric patients with COVID-19-related liver injury usually experience minor symptoms. COVID-19 patients with CLD have a higher risk of developing liver injury and progressing to severe cases. COVID-19 may aggravate their primary liver diseases and the prognosis mainly depends on the liver reserve capacity. In clinical practice, extra attention should be paid to the potential impact of underlying diseases on COVID-19-related liver injury, although the clinical data is still insufficient.\nSo far, the understanding of COVID-19-related liver injury has been constantly increasing. Recent research has shown that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect hepatocytes, providing a new vision for the pathogenesis of liver injury. In addition, close attention should be paid to the adverse effect of drugs on liver in the treatment for COVID-19, especially iDILI. In fact, there is compelling evidence that the liver injury observed in patients with COVID-19 is at least partially due to iDILI. To verify causality in suspected cases, the updated RUCAM published in 2016 should be used. Until there is verifiable evidence to support the theory, clinicians should carefully consider the risk of DILI and try to avoid the overuse of relevant drugs. At last, although COVID-19 vaccination has begun worldwide, the threat of COVID-19 and its hepatic damage should not be underestimated. Further research on effective treatment methods for COVID-19-related liver injury is essential. Clinical staff should continue to summarize the clinical characteristics and treatment experience of COVID-19-related liver injury to provide new theoretical basis for its standardized treatment and in-depth mechanism research.</br></br>UNKNOWN URL AND TITLE</br></br>All patients admitted to the University of Tennessee Medical Center since the designation of the pandemic on March 11, 2020 undergo COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swab sampling, including those patients directly admitted to an intensive care unit. The SARS-Co-V-2 assay manufactured by Intergy Laboratories (Knoxville, Tennessee) was utilized in the assessment of patients at the University of Tennessee Medical Center beginning on March 19, 2020. The Xpert Xpress SARS-Co-V-2 test (Cepheid; Sunnyvale, California) was utilized beginning in mid-April 2020, and the Panther Fusion SARS-C0-V-2 assay (Hologic, Inc.; Marlborough, Massachusetts) was used effective June 29, 2020, and continued to be used at the time of the completion of this study. While all patients underwent testing upon admission, non-uniform testing occurred thereafter. Some patients underwent repeat testing following a positive test result in preparation for tracheotomy, while some patients did not undergo repeat testing. All COVID-19 patients underwent chest imaging with plain films and CT scans without intravenous contrast. All symptomatic patients underwent CT angiograms of the chest to rule out pulmonary emboli.\nAll patients were medically assessed preoperatively by the critical care team, the oral and maxillofacial surgery team, and the anesthesia team in terms of the ideal time to perform the tracheotomy following consultation. While strict ventilator parameters [maximum rate in breaths per minute, maximum positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and maximum fraction of inspired oxygen (Fi02)] varied in terms of suitability for the tracheotomy procedure, the 3 teams agreed on a Pa02/Fi02 (P/F) of 100 or greater as an absolute standard to proceed.\nAll tracheotomy procedures were performed in an operating room with an anteroom located immediately adjacent to the operating room. The anteroom contained an inside door permitting entrance directly to the operating room and an exit door to the main hallway. Entrance to and exit from the operating room to the hallway can occur through the anteroom or directly through the operating room. Team members entered and exited the operating room, however through the anteroom rather than the front door to the operating room proper. In this manner, any potentially aerosolized virus in the operating room would be better contained within the operating room, rather than disseminating to the main hallway outside the operating room where other OR personnel not involved in the case might otherwise be exposed to aerosolized virus. Stated differently, the front door to the operating room was not opened during the procedure, but only permitted entrance and exit of the patient before and following the procedure. A 17-minute delay occurred by hospital protocol following all COVID-19 tracheotomy procedures before opening the front door to the operating room and transporting the patient back to the ICU. Additionally, the door from the anteroom to the operating and the door from the anteroom to the main hallway were never simultaneously opened. This protocol prevented aerosolized virus present in the operating from disseminating to the main hallway outside the operating room through the anteroom. The anteroom contained the scrub sinks and represented the area where doffing of the surgical team's personal protective equipment (PPE) occurred following the procedure.\nAll tracheotomy procedures were rehearsed with the 2 circulator nurses and 1 surgical technologist familiar with the team's standardized routine. Due to the short nature of the procedure, as well as the intention to limit team member exposure to the patient, this staff was not replaced during the procedure. One circulator nurse was physically present in the OR during the procedure and the other circulator nurse was present in the anteroom for retrieval of additional supplies that might be required of the surgical team during the tracheotomy procedure.\nEnhanced PPE was donned by all members of the support staff, surgical team, and anesthesia team. Enhanced PPE included an N95 mask, eye goggles or surgical loupes, a face/neck shield, surgical gown, and double gloves.\nAll tracheotomies were performed in the operating room under full sterile conditions, and all tracheotomies were open. A supramanubrial approach was uniformly executed and a standard dissection was performed of deep layers, identical to our approach for non-COVID patients14. Use of the electrocautery was minimized during the dissection. Use of the suction was similarly minimized during the procedure. The trachea was entered with an I incision and no suctioning of the airway occurred. An 8-Shiley® (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN), cuffed and non-fenestrated tracheostomy tube was placed when this tube was perceived to be of acceptable length, while a proximal XLT Shiley® tracheostomy tube (13.3 mm outer diameter) was placed when extra length was required. A Bivona® (Smiths Medical, Dublin, OH) tracheostomy tube was requested preoperatively for severely obese patients when the proximal XLT tracheostomy tube was anticipated to be of insufficient length (figure 2\n). The exchange of the endotracheal tube for the tracheostomy tube occurred as quickly as possible. Members of the surgical team secured the anesthetic circuitry to the tracheostomy tube and hyperinflated the tracheostomy tube cuff. The tracheostomy tube was secured to the neck skin with 4 point 2-0 silk sutures and a reinforcing VELCRO® strap around the neck.\nAll patients were administered long-acting neuromuscular blockade in the intensive care unit to avoid coughing during transport to the operating room and during the procedure. General anesthesia was administered through the existing endotracheal tube. Full and effective endotracheal cuff pressure was ensured prior to prepping the patient's skin. The heat and moisture exchanger (HME) was maintained on the endotracheal tube during the entirety of the case. The patient was maintained on 100% oxygen for most of the surgical procedure. Cessation of ventilation by the anesthesia team occurred upon request by the surgeon before the trachea was incised. Ventilation resumed immediately following hyperinflation of the tracheostomy tube cuff and verification of maintenance of cuff pressure. The HME was maintained on the circuitry connected to the tracheostomy tube. The patient was transported back to the ICU on 100% oxygen. The tracheostomy tube cuff pressure was converted from hyperinflation to conventional inflation thereafter.\nFollowing completion of the surgical procedure, members of the surgical team, including the surgical technologist individually and sequentially entered the anteroom for doffing of PPE. A dedicated team member, present in the anteroom during the surgical procedure, assisted individual team members with incremental removal of PPE with wiping of gloves and hands with a virucidal wipe (Sani-Cloth AF3 germicidal disposable wipe; PDI, Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey), before and after each step. The first step was removal of the outer set of gloves. The virucidal wiping of the outer set of gloves took place before their removal. Thereafter, a virucidal wiping of the inner set of gloves occurred. The face/neck shield was removed followed by virucidal wiping of the inner set of gloves. The gown was then removed followed by virucidal wiping of the inner set of gloves that were then removed. Bare hands were cleaned by virucidal wiping followed by removal of surgical loupes that were then placed in the loupe box. The team member then washed hands at the scrub sink and the door from the anteroom to the hallway was opened for the team member. This sequence was identically repeated for each team member until all members were doffed and exited the anteroom. All team members then changed their scrubs and exited the operating room complex. Team members were encouraged to shower if blood or other body fluids touched their skin.\nDescriptive and frequency statistics were performed to describe the sample's demographic and clinical characteristics. Statistical assumptions for continuous variables (normality and homogeneity of variance) were assessed before comparing the mortality groups (0 = lived versus 1 = died). There was a limited sample size for purposes of between-subjects analyses, and while non-parametric statistics could have been performed, the researchers chose to use parametric statistics to increase statistical power, as well as the precision of the statistical inferences. An adjustment was mace to the degrees of freedom when homogeneity of variance was violated so that parametric analyses could still be applied. Independent samples t-tests were performed to compare the mortality groups on age, BMI, P/F ratio at time of consultation, time to performance of tracheotomy after intubation, P/F ratio at time of tracheotomy, and time to consultation following intubation. Means and standard deviations were reported and interpreted for the t-test analyses. Statistical significance was assumed at an alpha value of 0.05 and the statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS Version 26 (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.).\nThe retrospective chart review of all patients consulted for the tracheotomy procedure by the primary surgeon (ERC) between March 11, 2020 and December 31, 2020 identified 76 patients. Fifty-six COVID-19 negative patients (53 underwent tracheotomy), and 20 COVID-19 patients were identified. Of the 20 COVID-19 positive patients, 17 underwent the tracheotomy procedure and comprise the focus of this retrospective study (table 1\n). Of the 3 COVID-19 patients who did not undergo the tracheotomy procedure, 1 patient (patient 2) was successfully extubated the day prior to the intended procedure, and 2 patients (patient 3 and 5) died before the tracheotomy procedure could be performed (table 2\n). Of the 17 COVID-19 patients undergoing the tracheotomy procedure, there were 13 males and 4 females. The age range was 30 to 75 years with a mean of 58 years. The patients’ body mass index (BMI) ranged from 10.8 to 70.4 with a mean of 34.5. Eight patients were obese, with 5 patients satisfying a diagnosis of obesity (BMI > 30, < 40) and 3 patients satisfying a diagnosis of severe obesity (BMI > 40). Other pre-existing medical comorbidity was noted in all patients, with 14 patients diagnosed with hypertension, 8 patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, and 6 patients diagnosed with hyperlipidemia. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome was pre-existing in 3 patients, chronic kidney disease was pre-existing in 3 patients, and coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease were pre-existing in 1 patient each. The time from intubation to tracheotomy consult ranged from 1 day to 22 days with a mean of 13.5 days. Preoperative medical treatment for the COVID-19 diagnoses in these 17 patients included remdesivir in 14 patients, convalescent plasma in 10 patients, dexamethasone in 10 patients, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in 1 patient.\nThe P/F ratio was available at the time of consult and at the time of tracheotomy in 14 of 17 COVID-19 patients undergoing tracheotomy (table 3\n). Of these 14 patients, the P/F was uniformly greater than 100 at the time of tracheotomy, and ranged from 101 to 341, with a range of 180. Only 1 study patient (patient 7) demonstrated a P/F greater than 300 at the time of consult and the time of tracheotomy. The tracheotomies were performed with a range of 4 days to 25 days following intubation, with a mean of 17 days. Estimated blood loss associated with the tracheotomy procedures ranged from 5-20 mL with a mean of 10 mL. There was no intraoperative morbidity or mortality associated with the procedures. Conventional 8-Shiley tracheostomy tubes were placed in 6 patients, proximal XLT tracheostomy tubes were placed in 10 patients, and a Bivona tracheostomy tube was placed in 1 patient. No tracheostomy tube dislodgements occurred postoperatively and no instances of clinically concerning bleeding were noted from the surgical sites postoperatively.\nSeven patients died between 4 and 16 days (mean = 8.7 days) following tracheotomy and died due to cessation of ventilator support (terminal wean) based on collective decisions made between our palliative care team, the medical center's biomedical ethicist, and family members. The 7 patients who died underwent their tracheotomy procedures between 7 and 25 days following intubation (mean = 18.2 days). Ten patients realized cessation of mechanical ventilation from 4 hours to 61 days, with a mean of 19.3 days. These 10 patients underwent their tracheotomy procedures between 4 and 22 days following intubation (mean = 14 days). Five patients realized successful ventilator weaning at our medical center while 5 patients were transferred to a long-term acute care facility and realized their successful ventilator weaning at that facility. All 10 patients who successfully weaned off mechanical ventilation are alive at the end of the study period. Three of these patients have been successfully decannulated. Of the 7 patients who underwent tracheotomy on or after 20 days of intubation (figure 3\n), 3 were alive at the end of the study period and 4 patients were dead. Of the 10 patients who underwent tracheotomy before 20 days of intubation (figure 3), 7 patients were alive at the end of the study period and 3 patients were dead.\nThe statistical assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance were met for the between-subjects comparisons of age, time to performance of tracheotomy after intubation, and time to consultation following intubation. Adjustments were made to the degrees of freedom for BMI, P/F ratio at time of consult, and P/F ratio at time of tracheotomy. Based on an independent samples t-test, it was found that participants that died were significantly older (mean [M] = 65.86, standard deviation [SD] = 6.01), versus those who survived (M = 52.70, SD = 9.55), p = 0.006. Individuals that died also had significantly lower P/F ratios at the time of consult, p = 0.047, and at the time of tracheotomy, p = 0.03. There were no significant differences between the mortality groups for BMI, p = 0.19; time to performance of tracheotomy after intubation, p = 0.44; and time to consultation following intubation, p = 0.64. The means and standard deviations for the independent samples t-tests are presented in Table 4\n.\nFrom March 13, 2020 through December 31, 2020, the University of Tennessee Medical Center in Knoxville tested 22,487 patients for COVID-19. Of these tested patients, 15,951 were negative (71%) and 6,536 (29%) were positive. During this same inclusive period, 151 COVID-19 positive patients (2.3%) required mechanical ventilation and 77 of these 151 patients (51%) died. The decision to perform a tracheotomy, the timing therein, and the protocols for the tracheotomy procedure represent very contentious issues in the care of the COVID-19 patient. At the core of this debate includes the perceived benefit of early vs. late tracheotomy, assumptions regarding the chronology of transmission of the virus, and justifiable concerns related to infectious risk to surgeons performing the tracheotomy procedure, members of the anesthesia team, and other personnel in the operating room during the procedure15. Numerous consensus and anecdotal guidelines recommended delaying tracheotomy, or avoiding the procedure entirely, to minimize the risk of transmission of the infection to team members caring for the patient 8\n,\n15, 16, 17, 18, 19. Specifically, avoiding early tracheotomy in this patient cohort was advised with the assumption that peak infectivity of the virus occurred at 7-10 days following the onset of symptoms such that performing the tracheotomy at that time would produce maximal risk to surgeons performing these procedures20.\nThe P/F ratio, as utilized in our study cohort, has been previously described to designate the severity of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)21 as well as a prognostic index in COVID-19 patients22. In 2012, Ranieri et al23 published findings of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine that convened a panel of international experts to discuss the definition of ARDS. The resulting Berlin definition of ARDS was established to predict the prognosis of ARDS and categorized ARDS as: mild (P/F between 200 and 300), moderate (P/F between 100 and 199), and severe (P/F less than 100). These categories were validated in 4188 ARDS patients that demonstrated an in-hospital mortality of 45% for severe ARDS, 32% for moderate ARDS, and 27% for mild ARDS. Delaying tracheotomy until the P/F was greater than 100 in our patient cohort was performed to further assess the short-term prognosis of these patients and to select those COVID-19 patients whose prognosis might be better, thereby justifying the performance of the tracheotomy procedure in these patients.\nHeyd et al17 reviewed the COVID-19 tracheotomy guidelines of 13 society or organizations including 5 from otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, 6 from anesthesiology, and 1 from pulmonary/critical care. All guidelines recommended postponing elective tracheotomy in these patients. Seven guidelines suggested only including essential team members such as 1 surgeon and 1 anesthesia team member. It was suggested that trainees not be present for the tracheotomy procedure. Delaying the tracheotomy procedure until the COVID patient had cleared the virus should be performed, if possible. To this end, Heyd et al17 recommended operating these patients only when negative testing existed, as might occur with 2 negative tests that are obtained 48 hours apart.\nDiscussion of COVID-19 in general, and pontification of tracheotomy procedures for these patients in particular, frequently result in conversations about aerosol-generating circumstances and interventions. Aerosols are defined as very small respiratory particles that can remain suspended in ambient air for long periods of time, can migrate greater than 6 feet beyond the patient, and can penetrate conventional surgical masks24. Klompas et al24 reviewed the World Health Organization's classification of endotracheal intubation, sputum induction, tracheotomy, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation as unequivocal aerosol-generating procedures. These procedures are so designated because they represent greater risk for health care team members in terms of transmission of disease. Klompas et al24 provide explanation of 4 factors that encourage infectious disease during medical and surgical procedures. The first factor is forced air as occurs in sustained ventilation during a tracheotomy procedure when the tube exchange is occurring. The second factor is patient symptomatology and disease severity. Symptomatic patients likely have a larger magnitude of virus than asymptomatic patients, and are therefore more likely to transmit disease to members of the health care team, particularly when procedures are performed. The third factor is distance, specifically related to the feature of respiratory emissions to become diluted in the surrounding air. Finally, the fourth factor is duration. Longer exposures to infected intuitively translate to higher incidences of transmissions of disease to health care team members. These 4 factors of aerosol-generating procedures must be carefully considered when planning and performing tracheotomy procedures in COVID-19 positive patients. In the protocol that we observed in our cohort of COVID-19 patients undergoing tracheotomy, the intentional period of apnea observed during entrance into the trachea and placement of the tracheotomy tube, as well as avoiding suctioning of the trachea during the procedure, decreased aerosolization associated with the procedure and decreased team member safety.\nChao et al16 reported on their determination as to whether a subset of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients existed for whom tracheotomy was indicated while also taking the risk of transmission to team members into account and the patient's prognosis. Their recommendations included considering tracheotomy in patients with a good prognosis and without significant medical comorbidity who had been intubated longer than 21 days. Further, they recommended against routine tracheotomy prior to 21 days in COVID-19 patients solely for ventilator dependence due to the high risk of infectious disease transmission to team members and the perceived poor prognosis of these patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Finally, the authors recommended that all patients should undergo COVID testing when they are being considered for tracheotomy, regardless of the presence or absence of COVID related symptoms.\nSommer et al8 indicated that elective tracheotomy should not be planned in a COVID-19 patient who is intubated until the patient is noted to be cleared of the virus and until isolation procedures are no longer in place. They indicated that the standard of care should involve extended endotracheal intubation of patients for the entire period of mechanical ventilation in these patients. Further, these authors recommended open tracheotomy performed in the operating room in the COVID-19 negative patient. Under these circumstances, the operating room personnel should be kept to a minimum, and the surgical team should wear N95 masks and full facial and neck protection due to the possibility of false-negative COVID-19 tests. The patient should be paralyzed during the procedure to prevent coughing that would otherwise result in aerosolization of virus when entering the trachea. The heat and moisture exchanger (HME) should be connected directly to the tracheotomy tube to reduce aerosolization of the virus in the event of disconnection of the anesthetic circuitry. Finally, the authors recommended avoiding or minimizing suctioning the airway after entrance into the trachea and before the tracheostomy tube is inserted.\nSkoog et al25 provided recommendations for tracheotomy during the COVID-19 pandemic in order the minimize transmission to members of the health care team. They indicated that tracheotomy can be delayed greater than 14 days in patients experiencing prolonged intubation. When performed in COVID-19 patients, the tracheotomy procedure should be performed in the intensive care unit to avoid transport of the patient in the hospital. The authors recommended neuromuscular blockade to avoid coughing and aerosolization, ventilation with inflation of the endotracheal cuff, ceasing ventilation before surgical entering the trachea, avoiding the use of suction once the trachea is entered, and the uniform use of personal protective equipment by team members to include and N95 mask, face shield, double gloves, powered air purifying respirator (PAPR) and/or Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) level 4 suit. All of these transmission precautions were observed in the care of our patients with the exception of the PAPR and AAMI level 4 suit.\nStubington et al26 prospectively reported the results of 12 COVID-19 patients undergoing a tracheotomy procedure in March-April, 2020. Their recommendations for patient selection included those who were at least 14 days post-nasopharyngeal swab positive test result, FiO2 less than or equal to 40% for at least 24 hours prior to the procedure, supine patients, 2 unsuccessful trials of withholding sedation, and the patient's tolerance of clamping the tube for 1 minute in the intensive care unit. Their patient outcomes were more favorable when the FiO2 was 50% or less and the PEEP was 8 or less in the first 48 hours following the tracheotomy procedure than patients whose ventilator settings exceeded these values.\nYeung et al27 reported on 1257 COVID-19 positive patients who were admitted to King's College Hospital in London, England from March 10 – May 18, 2020. One hundred seventy-six of these patients were admitted to the intensive care unit and required mechanical ventilation. Of these 176 patients, 72 underwent tracheotomy. Forty-four patients underwent open tracheotomy while 28 patients underwent percutaneous tracheotomy. The tracheotomy procedures took place at a median of 17 days following intubation with a median FiO2 of 40% and a median PEEP of 8.5. The objective to wean sedation and mechanical ventilation was successful in 79 and 61% of patients, respectively. Twenty-one percent of patients were weaned from mechanical ventilation in 7 days or less, and 44.4% of patients were weaned from mechanical ventilation at 14 days or less. The authors concluded that the outcomes of open tracheotomy were comparable to those of percutaneous tracheotomy, and open tracheotomy did not pose an increased risk of COVID-19 transmission to team members.\nTornari et al28 performed an observational cohort study of 312 patients admitted to the intensive unit of their hospital from March 1, 2020 – May 10, 2020. Two hundred sixty-six patients were intubated and 78 patients underwent tracheotomy with a median of 16 days following endotracheal intubation. Four patients died before sedation weaning as a result of their COVID-19 and 5 additional patients did not meet inclusion criteria for the study. The outcomes of 69 patients undergoing tracheotomy were therefore able to be analyzed. Fifty-nine patients (85.5%) experienced cessation of sedation following tracheotomy with a mean of 4 days. Cessation of mechanical ventilation occurred in 46 patients (66.6%) with a mean of 12 days following tracheotomy. Decannulation occurred in 35 patients (50.7%) with a mean of 16 days following tracheotomy. The authors did not assess cessation of mechanical ventilation as a function of timing of the tracheotomy procedure, but they indicated that decannulation was delayed in patients with higher FiO2 (> 40%) and higher pre-tracheotomy peak cough flow.\nAviles-Juardo et al29 prospectively studied 50 consecutive COVID-19 patients who were admitted to an intensive care unit and who required open bedside tracheotomy between March 16, 2020 and April 10, 2020. The median length of time of endotracheal intubation was 9 days prior to tracheotomy. Thirty-two patients underwent early tracheotomy, not temporally defined by the authors and 18 patients underwent late tracheotomy, also not temporally defined by the authors. The success of weaning mechanical ventilation following tracheotomy was greater in the early tracheotomy group compared to the late tracheotomy group, but the difference was not statistically significant. There was less overall time of mechanical ventilation in the early tracheotomy group compared to the late tracheotomy group, and the reduction was accomplished with the reduction of the pre-tracheotomy time of mechanical ventilation. The authors concluded that open tracheotomy performed bedside in the intensive care unit with a standardized approach is safe for patients and surgeons. They indicated that early tracheotomy might be associated with reduced intensive care unit beds during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTay et al30 made recommendations for tracheotomy during the COVID-19 pandemic by drawing on experiences from the SARS epidemic of 2003 when tracheotomy was the most common surgical procedure performed. They indicated that percutaneous tracheotomy involves excessive manipulation of the airway including bronchoscopy and sequential dilations during entrance in the trachea. Increased aerosolization occurs compared to open tracheotomy such that open tracheotomies were performed during the 2003 SARS epidemic and might be favored during the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors emphasized that the principles of team planning and the protection of team members are paramount. Further, they indicated that as the COVID-19 pandemic escalates, so will the requirement for tracheotomies in this patient cohort with prolonged mechanical ventilation. While these authors recommended open tracheotomy as the preferred method in the management of COVID-19 patients, other authors discussed the acceptable safety profiles of percutaneous tracheotomy in these patients31\n,\n32.\nKwak et al15 performed a retrospective chart review of 148 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who required mechanical ventilation from March 1 to May 7, 2020, and who required a tracheotomy. For the patients (n = 52 patients) undergoing early tracheotomy, the mean time from intubation to tracheotomy was 5.58 days, and the time to discontinuation of mechanical ventilation was 26.5 days following intubation. For the late tracheotomy group (n = 96 patients), the mean time from intubation to tracheotomy was 15.83 days., and the time to discontinuation of mechanical ventilation was 31 days following intubation. At the conclusion of the study, 108 patients (73%) had experienced discontinuation of ventilator support, 94 patients (64%) had been decannulated, 107 (72%) had been discharged from the hospital, and 30 patients (20%) had died.\nBreik et al33 reported the outcomes of the first 100 COVID-19 patients who underwent tracheotomy by a dedicated airway team at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, England from March 9 to April 21, 2020. One hundred sixty-four COVID-19 patients were identified during this time, 100 of whom underwent tracheotomy. The time from intubation to the tracheotomy procedure ranged from 5 to 29 days with a mean of 13.9 days. Twenty-five patients underwent tracheotomy in the operating room and 75 patients underwent percutaneous tracheotomy in the intensive care unit. Nine patients underwent tracheotomy before 10 days of endotracheal intubation, 55 patients underwent tracheotomy between 10 and 14 days, and 36 patients underwent tracheotomy after 14 days of endotracheal intubation. The 3-day survival for the 100 patients undergoing tracheotomy was 68.3% (112/164). The 30-day survival was statistically higher for patients undergoing tracheotomy (85/100) compared to the patients who did not (27/64). The improved survival was independent of the patient's baseline prognosis. The authors indicated that tracheotomy is recommended to their COVID-19 patients when they are intubated longer than 10 days. Benefits therein included the ability to safely wean sedation, the performance of more effective pulmonary toilet, and improved patient comfort. They concluded that the performance of a tracheotomy in COVID-19 positive patients was consistent with patient safety and reasonable to perform when the patient was physiologically suitable to undergo this procedure rather than waiting for a defined period to transpire following intubation. Schultz et al34 supported the 10-day recommendation for tracheotomy in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients based on their review of the literature.\nFinally, increased team member safety during the performance of tracheotomies in COVID-19 patients is at least theoretically possible when these patients have been treated pharmacologically. As noted in our cohort, 3 agents, remdesivir, convalescent plasma, and dexamethasone, have been recommended for <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightgreen; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">use<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">usages</span>\n</mark> in these patients35\n,\n36. <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightorange; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">Remdesivir<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">chemical</span>\n</mark> , a monophosphate prodrug that is metabolized to a biologically active C-adenosine nucleoside triphosphate analogue, was originally discovered during an antimicrobial assessment of drugs against RNA viruses including Coronaviridae and Flaviviridae36. The initial clinical use of remdesivir was in the setting of Ebola, but its use in COVID-19 is at least theoretically indicated based on case report data31. Unanswered questions exist regarding the transmissibility of remdesivir treated COVID-19 patients to health care workers during tracheotomy procedures. Shen et al36 treated 5critically ill COVID-19 patients with convalescent plasma. The viral load of these patients declined within days of treatment, and the clinical and radiographic parameters of these patients improved as noted by improved P/F, decreased temperature, and improved chest imaging. Due to a decreased viral load of COVID-19 patients treated with convalescent plasma, one could surmise that their viral transmissibility would decrease to team members involved in tracheotomy procedures. The use of corticosteroids such as dexamethasone in the management of COVID-19 patients is based on the ability to decrease the host inflammatory lung response that promotes acute lung injury and ARDS. This treatment is of questionable benefit due to the possibility of delayed clearance of the virus and the increased potential for secondary bacterial infection of the lungs35. The use of corticosteroids remains controversial in the management of COVID-19 patients, and no ability exists to predict the potential increased safety of team members participating in tracheotomy procedures in these patients.\nThe limitations of this study include the low number of patients and the inability to determine team member safety related to the procedure. In terms of team member safety, it is not possible to trace transmission of disease to team members from specific contacts, including patients who underwent tracheotomy in this study. While 4 residents participating in the care of these patients became COVID-19 positive at variable times following the tracheotomy procedures, the primary surgeon repeatedly tested negative for COVID-19 and was vaccinated in January 2021. Contact tracing for the positive residents could therefore not definitively establish transmission from a patient in this study, or another COVID-19 patient, unrelated to this study, for whom the residents cared during the study period. Finally, the sample size for the present study was relatively small (n = 17) and larger studies might be able yield more precise and accurate effects associated with tracheotomies in COVID-19 patients. Causal inferences cannot be made from the current study due to the lack of randomization. Future researchers may want to use the effect sizes generated from our study to power larger retrospective studies to permit further investigation regarding the association of tracheotomies and COVID-19 survival, especially as it relates to clinical parameters such as BMI and comorbid disease history. We anticipate larger numbers of tracheotomies in COVID-19 patients in the future with the ability to ascertain durable benefit to these patients who experience prolonged intubation. Moreover, we plan to perform a follow-up study of the 10 surviving tracheotomy patients in this study to determine any future adverse sequelae of their disease such as pulmonary fibrosis and cognitive dysfunction.\nTracheotomies performed in COVID-19 patients are safe and medically beneficial procedures for patients when performed with a standardized protocol such as that discussed in this study. The exact timing of this surgical procedure remains speculative in the international literature however, we recommend guidelines identical to those of non-COVID-19 patients in which intentions to reduce the incidence of laryngeal stenosis and subglottic stenosis, and limiting medical resources such as ventilators and sedative agents are important. To this end, early consultation might be beneficial to patients, with the exact timing of tracheotomy in COVID-19 patients being based on their ventilator parameters, P/F result, perceived patient prognosis, the existence of patient advanced directives, and family wishes. Not uncommonly, medical center ethics committees are very useful to this end and should be utilized in the decision-making process. Finally, we recommend the inclusion of trainees in the performance of tracheotomies in COVID-19 patients as part of standardized teams and protocols to properly prepare these residents and fellows for their future practices.</br></br>UNKNOWN URL AND TITLE</br></br>The new emerging coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, is characterized by a wide spectrum of symptoms and clinical course from asymptomatic form to mild or serious illness. Unfortunately, a subset of patients develops an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) consisting of an intense pneumonia associated with a systemic immune response that is able to compromise organ functions and frequently leads to fatal event [1]. The pathogenetic mechanisms involved in COVID-19 aggravation have not been deeply understood in these few months since its first appearance. Anyway, ARDS in COVID-19 looks like those of two other previous coronavirus epidemics, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in which the abnormal host immune response has been recognized as the main determinant leading to adverse outcome. Indeed, in COVID-19, very critical patients display a cytokine storm syndrome with an increased secretion of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, IL-17, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interferon (IFN)-γ and other pro-inflammatory mediators [1,2]. This over-production of pro-inflammatory cytokines induces more damage to the host cells than the one induced by SARS-CoV-2 as pathogen invader. Besides the high cytokine release, a relevant worsening of systemic functionality has been registered, with a reduction of total circulating lymphocytes, infiltration of monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils in the lungs, vasculitis with hypercoagulability, increase of C-reactive protein, transaminases, ferritin, and creatinine serum levels. All these features point out that multiple organ damages have occurred [3]. Hence, it is evident that either prevention or resolution of hyper-inflammation are crucial determinants to avoid mortality in COVID-19.\nAs currently no specific therapies are available and the management of the disease is only supportive, the entire research community is looking at other better-known syndromes in which such a scenario looks like that of ARDS in COVID-19. Indeed, observational data have shown overlapping clinical features with some autoimmune diseases characterized by a massive release of cytokines.\nSecondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), also called macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), is known as severe disorder characterized by intense hyper-immune response ultimately leading to a cytokine storm. sHLH/MAS has been described by the presence of several signs of immune-dysfunction, such as (i) natural killer cells inability to clear antigen after infection or autoimmune stimulation; (ii) persistence of antigen presentation; (iii) repression of regulatory T (Treg) cell functionality; (iv) activation and proliferation of tissue macrophages (histiocytes); and (v) secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by activated histiocytes, which induces systemic hyper-inflammatory syndrome [4,5]. Clinical features and laboratory data of sHLH include sustained fever, splenomegaly, hyper-ferritinemia, pancytopenia, fibrinolytic consumptive coagulopathy and liver dysfunction [6], which are very close to those described in severe COVID-19. sHLH can arise as a result of infectious or autoimmune diseases. Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus, most frequently, or influence and dengue infections, to a lesser extent, can trigger sHLH [7]. Among the autoimmune diseases, sHLH derives principally from complication of systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis or its adult equivalent, adult onset Still disease, even though it can also occur in other systemic inflammatory disorders i.e., systemic lupus erythematosus, Kawasaki disease, and periodic fever syndromes [5,6]. Besides sHLH, similarities between severe COVID-19 and other more common autoimmune diseases, in which naive T helper (Th) cells preferentially differentiate in Th1 and Th17 subsets rather than Th2 and Treg cells have also been documented. Actually, abnormal activation of Th1 and Th17 cells leads to increased secretion of IFN-γ, IL-2, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-17, IL-21, and IL-6, which triggers inflammation. In addition, a reduced functionality of Treg helps to keep the inflammatory response turned on [8]. Rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren’s syndrome, multiple sclerosis, and inflammatory bowel diseases present that peculiarity.\nFor a long time, corticosteroid drugs have been largely used in autoimmune diseases management for their role as remission inducers and their broad spectrum anti-inflammatory action [9]. The main effects of glucocorticoids are to inhibit several pro-inflammatory genes encoding cytokines, chemokines, cell adhesion molecules, and enzymes to address the inflammatory process and restore homeostasis. Although their efficacy in suppressing inflammation is well recognized, corticosteroid drugs display many adverse events, including high risk of developing comorbidities, especially infections [10]. Thus, the results of clinical studies on the role of corticosteroids in infectious diseases showing inflammatory hallmarks is still controversial. Corticosteroids have been widely used also during SARS and MERS coronavirus disease outbreaks. A recent meta-analysis study, examining SARS, MERS trials and the first results on COVID-19 clinical experimentation, reported that treatment with corticosteroids raised the mortality rate and reduced virus clearance [11], although a final response is still missing.\nDrugs counteracting the biological effects of cytokines are now largely used in rheumatology and in other autoimmune diseases and they have demonstrated efficacy. Anti-IL-1, anti-TNF-α, and anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibodies can deplete each specific target slowing down the cytokine storm. Tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor blocker, has been used to manage autoimmune diseases, indeed, it has been approved for the treatment of a variety of clinical conditions that display cytokine release syndrome [9], and it is having promising results also in severe COVID-19 [12]. Baricitinib is an oral drug used in rheumatoid arthritis treatment. It functions as a blocker of Janus kinases (JAK), the upstream activating enzymes of the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) involved in type I/II IFNs and IL-6 signaling [13]. The use of JAK inhibitors is attractive because they are well tolerated, and give the opportunity to target numerous inflammatory cytokine signaling pathways simultaneously [14,15].\nIn conclusion, biological drugs, blocking specific cytokine effects, are repurposed to counteract the inflammatory host response triggered by SARS-CoV-2 [16]. Actually, many clinical trials are undergoing to prove their efficacy.\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease with persistent inflammation of synovial joints which can lead to articular bone and cartilage disruption [19].\nHaqqi et al., firstly reported a protective effect of green tea polyphenols (0.2% GTE solution in drinking water) in a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model of RA in which a reduced incidence of arthritis and a downregulation of inflammatory mediators, i.e., IFN-γ, TNF-α, cyclooxygenase 2, were attested [20]. Amelioration of adjuvant-induced mouse arthritis was reported by Ahmed et al. who showed how EGCG (100 mg/kg, by intraperitoneal injection (i.p)., administrated daily from day 7 to day 16) can inhibit IL-6 synthesis and suppress its signaling by producing the soluble form of gp130 IL-6-co-receptor [21]. GTE added in the drinking water (8 g/L, 2/week) reduced RA symptoms also in a rat model of adjuvant-induced arthritis showing a decrease of IL17 and a concomitant increase of IL-10 serum level, suggesting that Th17 and Treg cell subsets can be regulated in the opposite way by these polyphenols [22]. It must be reminded here that high Th17/Treg ratio is a hallmark of RA [23]. Hence, molecules that are able to restore the balance between Th17 and Treg could be crucial tools for RA management.\nThe mechanism of Th17 reduction was investigated in a CIA mouse model, in which the EGCG treatment (40 mg/kg, 3/week, i.p.) was able to decrease the number of phospho-STAT3 positive T cells [24]. Similar data were reported by Brun et al. who attested the suppression of both STAT3 activity and Th17 cell differentiation (20 mg/kg of EGCG, 3/week, i.p.) [25]. In addition, Lee et al. further confirmed the capability of EGCG (20–50 mg/kg, 3/week, i.p.) to downregulate Th17 clonal expansion, suppress STAT3 activity, but they also registered an increase of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) activity, and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression [26]. Notably, Th17 clonal expansion needs STAT3-dependent-IL6 signaling [27], thus, experimental data obtained by these groups are in line with the reduction of IL-6 expression and signaling previously reported by Ahmed et al. [21]. \nFinally, to evaluate the risk factor on RA onset, it must be highlighted the result of a prospective cohort study including 30,000 old women of Iowa (USA) without a history of the disease. Women consuming >3 cups/day of tea displayed an inverse association risk of RA onset [28]. Even though this is a promising result, further clinical experimentations are required to prove the preventive and therapeutic effects of EGCG in human RA.\nSjogren’s syndrome (SS) is a relatively common autoimmune disease characterized by lacrimal and salivary glands inflammation. In SS, autoantigen expression and apoptotic cell death are important etiological factors leading to loss of secretory function [29,30]. EGCG can protect autoimmune-induced distress of salivary glands in non-obese diabetic mouse model of SS syndrome. EGCG administration (0.1–0.2% EGCG solution in drinking water) reduced lymphocytic infiltration in the glands, as well as inhibited apoptosis and cell proliferation [29]. Hsu et al. demonstrated that GTE (0.2% GTE solution in drinking water) can decrease autoantibody level in animal serum, and showed that EGCG can prevent the TNF-α-induced cytotoxicity in ex vivo salivary gland cells [30]. Saito et al. used an autoimmune sialadenitis model of MRL-Fas-lpr mice in which oxidative damage triggers apoptosis in salivary gland cells. Damaged glands displayed a reduced expression of water channel aquaporin 5 (AQP5), resulting in a low exocrine flow of saliva following pilocarpine stimulation. EGCG (592 µg/mouse in drinking water, for 57 days) was able to restore AQP5 expression level, finally improving gland functionality. The EGCG-protective action (2 and 10 mg/kg in drinking water, for ten days) was mediated by the inactivation of both nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and by the preservation of protein kinase A activity [31]. All data suggest that EGCG supplementation can be efficacious also in a little but well-defined area of the body in which inflammatory damage had occurred.\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a T-cell dependent autoimmune disease involving nervous system and displaying inflammation, demyelination, axonal injury, and gliosis [18]. A well-characterized rodent model for human MS is the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), in which the disease is induced by animal immunization with myelin derived proteins. Similarly to MS, EAE histopathology showed signs of perivascular inflammatory lesions and demyelination in the central nervous system (CNS) [8].\nNeuroprotective attribute of EGCG is well-known for its ability to increase antioxidant enzymes activities, such as superoxide dismutase and catalase, in the brain [32]. Aktas et al. firstly demonstrated in a EAE model that EGCG (100 µL/mouse in saline, 3/die, by oral gavage) suppressed brain inflammation and reduced symptoms and neuronal damages [33]. These protective effects were mediated by inhibition of both NF-κB activity and expression of its target gene TNF-α [33]. In this regard, we highlighted that NF-κB is a transcription factor crucial for MS pathogenesis given that it regulates genes encoding inflammatory mediators and plays key roles in resident cells of the CNS during disease development [34]. Wang et al. confirmed in EAE mice that EGCG, dose dependently (0.15–0.6%, orally, for 30 days), ameliorated clinical symptoms, delayed diseases onset, reduced inflammatory infiltration and demyelination damage [35]. Mechanistically, EGCG altered the balance between T cell subsets, reducing Th1 and Th17 pro-inflammatory T cells and promoting Treg cell population with the consequent decrease in IFN-γ and IL17 production. Since low level of IL6 expression is crucial to redirect transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-induced naïve T cells to Treg subtype instead of Th17 one, IL6 secretion has been measured. Data showed that EGCG inhibited IL6 production, as well as, both ICAM1 expression and leukocytes infiltration in the CNS, accordingly with the noted role of adhesion molecules to regulate immune-cell migration across the blood–brain barrier [35]. Importantly, as the EAE improvement took place even if the EGCG was administered 7-12 days after immunization, the authors concluded that the EGCG effect is largely therapeutic rather than preventive and, therefore, EGCG could be suitable for MS therapy.\nMoreover, several studies promoted the association between EGCG (300 µg, 2/die, by oral gavage, for 50 days) and other natural products, such as glatiramer acetate in EAE model [36,37], or coconut oil in MS patients [38]. In all these studies synergistic effects of the combination therapy were registered. EGCG and glatiramer acetate can improve the expression of both brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and beneficial cytokines in CNS [36], and promote an increase in HO-1 expression level [37], whereas, in MS patients, EGCG (800 mg/die, orally, for 4 months) plus coconut oil improved anxiety and disability by decreasing IL6 serum level [38]. The clinical trials using EGCG in MS patients are shown in Table 1.\nIn conclusion, the therapeutic effects of EGCG in MS are promising. The beneficial impact was supported by its multiple molecular target activity and its good CNS bioavailability.\nCrohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) mediated by immune dysregulation [39]. The IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, and IFN-γ unbalance drives to chronic inflammatory status that interferes with the homeostasis of the gastrointestinal tract finally leading to diarrhea, bloating, gas, bleeding, and abdominal pain [40]. In addition, IBD are characterized by oxidative and nitrative stress, leukocyte infiltration, and up-regulation of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) expression in the colon [41].\nSeveral studies have been performed to prove whether EGCG administration could be helpful in the IBD. Human T-cell line Kit 225, similarly to primary Th17 cell subtype, can secrete IL-17 and other pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α. In either unstimulated or IL-23 stimulated T-cell Kit 225, EGCG treatment inhibited IL-17 and TNF-α expression [42]. The protective effect of green tea polyphenols was confirmed by an acetic acid-induced colitis model, in which EGCG (50 mg/kg/die, by oral gavage) improved rat mucosal inflammation by drastically decreasing TNF-α, IFN-γ, and NF-κB expression levels and reducing nitric oxide (NO) production and malondialdehyde activity [43]. In a different rat model of experimental colitis, induced by intracolonic instillation of dinitrobenzene sulphonic acid, we showed that treatment with GTE (50 mg/kg/die, i.p.) significantly attenuated diarrhea and loss of body weight. These effects were associated with a remarkable improvement of the disrupted colonic architecture, with significant reduction of myeloperoxidase and TNF-α production. GTE also reduced both the appearance of nitro-tyrosine tissue immunoreactivity and the expression of ICAM-1 [41]. IL-2 knockout C57BL/6 mice develop a colon inflammation comparable to the human ulcerative colitis, in which the cytokine profile is consistent with a Th1-type host immune response leading to an increase of IFN-γ and TNF-α expression levels [44]. Lamina propria lymphocytes were isolated from colon of IL-2 KO mice treated or not with green tea polyphenols, and then cultured ex vivo. GTE (5 g/L in drinking water) markedly reduced lymphocytes IFN-γ production. Authors commented that green tea polyphenols, that are able to modulate Th1-mediated response in the gut, are likely to be of significant clinical relevance in the treatment of Crohn’s disease which displays Th1 feature [44]. In another type of experimental colon injury, dextran sodium sulfate administration can induce erosion and increases permeability in colonic epithelium, which results in clinical signs of ulcerative colitis. In this model, EGCG treatment (20 and 50 mg/kg/die, by oral gavage) prevented colon shortening, and improved both intestinal permeability and histopathological changes. In particular, the EGCG-elicited attenuation of colonic lesions was accompanied by IL-6, MCP-1, TNF-α suppression and inhibition of macrophage infiltration [45]. In the same animal model, using both wild type and IL-10 deficient rats, Oz et al. reported that EGCG (0.12–0.5%/die incorporated into daily diet) significantly attenuated the colitis severity in a comparable way to sulfasalazine [46]. The authors concluded that, as sulfasalazine, commonly used in IBD therapy, has serious adverse effects, these promising results suggest that EGCG or GTE could become an alternative safe therapy for human IBD.\nIn many experimental models of acute inflammation, we proved the anti-inflammatory effects of polyphenols present in the GTE [41,47,48,49,50]. In particular, in a mouse model of carrageenan-induced pleurisy, we reported that GTE (25 mg/kg, i.p.) attenuated lung injury by lowering ICAM-1 and TNF-α expression, STAT-1 activation, nitrotyrosin and polyADP-ribosyl protein modifications, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) accumulation in the lungs [47]. We also used an animal model of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) characterized by lung injury followed by hepatic, intestinal, renal, and cardiac dysfunctions. MODS results in the simultaneous trigger of complement, coagulation, and fibrinolytic cascades which induce a generalized inflammatory response. The latter leads to the activation of phagocytes and endothelial cells and release of many cytokines and other pro-inflammatory mediators [51]. MODS displays similar features to that of ARDS in COVID-19. In this model, triggered by zymosan administration in mice, we provided evidence that GTE reduces (i) development of zymosan-induced peritonitis, (ii) PMNs infiltration in the lung and intestine, (iii) renal dysfunction and (iv) liver, lung, pancreatic and intestinal injury [48].\nThe molecular mechanisms underlined the protective effects of GTE have been investigated in in vitro experiments on human epithelial cell lines, including A549 alveolar and DLD1 colon cells. We demonstrated the capability of EGCG, at 5–20 µM range, and GTE at 4–40 µg/mL range, to strongly inhibit IFN-γ-triggered STAT1 activation. EGCG/GTE exerted their effect toward the inhibition of JAK2-elicited STAT1 phosphorylation, leading to the blockade of the expression of target genes i.e., inducible nitric oxide synthase, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand (CXCL)9, CXCL10, ICAM1, and the class II major histocompatibility complex HLA-DR [52,53,54]. The anti-inflammatory action of EGCG was not mediated by its antioxidant activity because N-acetyl-cysteine and ascorbate were ineffective [54]. \nIFNs are crucial cytokines in inflammation and in pathogen infection diseases. They belong to different classes with either overlapped or specific functions. Extracellular secreted type I IFNs (IFN-α/IFN-β) play the first battle against viral infection. Actually, type I IFNs, secreted from infected cells, bind to their transmembrane receptors activating STAT1 and STAT2 and trigger IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression which rapidly generates a cellular antiviral state [55]. Whereas, type II IFN-γ is an important mediator of immunity and inflammation, since it plays a crucial role in macrophage activation, autoimmunity and Th1 response. IFN-γ signal takes advantage of STAT1 pathway to achieve transcriptional activation of IFN-γ-inducible genes, some of them encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines [56]. Nevertheless, viruses can blind the immune system inducing an inadequate host response. Indeed, SARS-CoV failed to induce competent IFN response in SARS patients [57]. Even though the IFN response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is not well characterized, the first important experimental data are now emerging. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a cellular receptor which allows SARS-CoV-2 internalization in the host cell. Ziegler et al. identified ACE2 as an interferon-stimulated gene. Indeed, in the primary basal cells of nasal mucosa a significant induction of ACE2 was found after IFN-α2 and, to a lesser extent, IFN-β or IFN-γ stimulation [58]. Accordingly, ACE2, in human but not in mouse, must be considered a canonical ISG for the presence of STAT1, STAT3, IRF8, and IRF1 binding sites on its promoter [58]. Another fundamental study analyzed the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from eight COVID-19 patients in comparison with either healthy controls or non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients [59]. A distinct pattern of gene expression has been found in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with respect to healthy subjects as well as to those of SARS-CoV or other pathogen-induced pneumonia patients. Data derived from the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV outbreaks have revealed that these coronaviruses suppress type-I IFN response by interfering with Janus kinases/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling [16]. On the contrary, SARS-CoV-2 triggers a robust IFN response by increasing the expression of several ISGs [59]. Nevertheless, the protective potential of some ISGs failed to inhibit virus replication, perhaps for the above described ACE2 super-induction, instead an aggravation of lung inflammation occurred. In this regard, by a genomic analysis at the BALF cells of COVID-19 patients, Zhou et al. showed a high enrichment of ISG members belonging to the inflammatory regulation cluster which included neutrophil-recruiting mediators CXCL8, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL10, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand (CCL)2, CCL7 and other attractants of monocytes and immune cells CXCL6, CXCL11, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL7, CCL8, as well as STAT1 itself which, by positive feedback, leads to the persistence of the inflammatory status [59]. In COVID-19 patients, all data suggest a preponderance of pro-inflammatory purpose in the response to IFNs instead to develop antiviral reaction [59]. This could be deleterious because, in that way, IFNs can support the cytokine storm. In agreement with these data, Major et al. described a mechanism by which type I and III IFNs signaling aggravated lung pathology in coronavirus-infected mice [60]. Moreover, Broggi et al. reported that type III IFN-λ, produced by lung dendritic cells following viral recognition, induced barrier damage by inhibiting lung epithelial repair [61]. All these results provide a strong rational for using molecules that are able to block JAK/STAT activity, such as JAK inhibitors, in COVID-19 therapy. Indeed, many clinical trials are ongoing to test JAK inhibitors efficacy (i.e., tofacitinib, NCT 04412252, NCT04415151, NCT04332042; baricitinib, NCT04390464, NCT04393051, NCT04373044, NCT04321993, NCT04345289, NCT04320277, NCT04340232; ruxolitinib, NCT04362137, NCT04414098, NCT04331665, NCT04377620, NCT04338958, NCT04334044, NCT04348071). To further examine the clinical trials listed above, we recall Table 1 presented in the review of Luo et al. [15]. The advantage of JAK/STAT pathway inhibition should reside in the blockade of several cytokines and chemokines synthesis and secretion [62]. Thus, JAK/STAT inhibitors, both in autoimmune diseases [62] and in COVID-19 [15], are attractive therapeutic tools to abrogate signaling pathway versus multiple targets at the same time. EGCG/GTE, at low micromolar concentration in in vitro and in preclinical studies, act as STAT1 inhibitors like the synthetic JAK inhibitors. \nSeveral studies supported a broad anti-inflammatory action of EGCG and GTE which cannot be limited to scavenging toxic oxidants and to inhibit STAT-1 activity. As already reported, STAT3 activation was also reduced by EGCG and GTE administration [24,25,26]. Similarly to STAT1 [53], the molecular mechanism involved in the STAT3 inhibition was elucidated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay and by in silico docking model [63]. SPR assay indicated that EGCG significantly interrupted STAT3 peptide binding at micromolar concentrations, and docking experiments indicated that EGCG competitively binds to the STAT3 SH2 domain, inhibiting STAT3 phosphorylation and signaling [63]. Importantly, in the immune system, most of the cytokine receptors, including the receptors of IL-6, IL-10, IL-21, and IL-23, can activate STAT3 indicating that it is an important nuclear factor for the regulation of immune responses and autoimmunity [64]. It is also known that in COVID-19 hyper-inflammatory condition, high level of IL-6 seem to be the main prognostic factor for worse outcomes. Indeed, the use of drugs that are able to inhibit IL-6 signaling, such as tocilizumab, can block the progression of disease [12] and, in a similar way, EGCG could be promising too because it is a powerful blocker of STAT3 pathway.\nEGCG/GTE can also prevent the activation of NF-κB [31,33,43,65,66,67,68,69], the main architect of inflammatory signals for its key role in numerous immunologic processes. NF-κB controls the expression of many pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, TNF-α, IL8, IL-6, all of which are induced in the cytokines storm syndrome [70,71] and in COVID-19 [72,73].\nThe anti-inflammatory action of EGCG/GTE also derives by their ability to activate Nrf2 nuclear translocation and HO-1 activity leading to protective effects, in particular, on neuronal cells [74], in arthritis [75], and in atherosclerosis [76].\nThus, EGCG/GTE should be repurposed in COVID-19 with the aim to revert the hyper-inflammatory status. \nWe also discuss the importance to target lung fibrosis. A substantial proportion of patients who develop ARDS die for the progressive pulmonary fibrosis. Important fibrosis mediators include matrix metalloproteinases, associated with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and cytokines release, that induce epithelial and endothelial injury [77]. The pulmonary fibrosis in COVID-19 patients occurs because SARS-CoV-2 infection induces massive increase of neutrophils infiltration into the lungs, with the production and the activation of TGF-β. Uncontrolled increase in active TGF-β, with the help of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNFα, IL-6, and IL-1β, results in rapid and massive edema and fibrosis that remodels and ultimately blocks the airways, finally leading to the lung functional failure [78]. Indeed, the risk of poor outcome is higher in fibrotic lung disease following SARS-CoV-2 infection than in not-fibrotic one. In addition, the global burden of fibrotic lung disease increases considerably with age, male sex, and comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes [79]. Therefore, there is an urgent need for therapies that mitigate lung fibrosis in severe COVID-19 [79].\nIt must be reminded the protective effects of EGCG/GTE in different models of lung fibrosis. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a lethal chronic progressive pulmonary disease and the TNF-alpha transgenic mouse is an animal model for human IPF. These mice overexpress TNF-alpha only in the lungs and have been used to verify the protective effect of GTE. The TNF-α overexpression was continuous, IL-1α and IL-1β were overexpressed only in the early stage, while IL-6 production increased along with the progression of interstitial pneumonia. These data suggest that IL-6 secretion contributed, together with TNF-α, to the development of the disease [80]. After treatment with GTE, mRNA and protein levels of TNF-α and IL-6 were reduced by 70% and 80%, respectively, suggesting that green tea has significant preventive effects on the TNF-α-related diseases [80]. Moreover, beneficial efficacy of EGCG (20 mg/kg, i.p., for 28 days) was reported against a bleomycin-induced rat model of lung fibrosis, in which lysosomal hydrolases and ultrastructural changes in the lungs were improved [81]. In the same model, Sriram et al. showed that EGCG (20 mg/kg, i.p., for 28 days) supplementation reduced NF-κB activity, TNF-α, IL-1β expression and induced Nrf2 signaling [82]. In addition, EGCG inhibited fibroblast activation and collagen accumulation by downregulating TGF-β1 signaling [83]. In conclusion, EGCG/GTE can be considered as potent anti-fibrotic agents.\nSeveral clinical trials have been performed to test the safety and the advantages of EGCG supplementation in either prevention or therapeutic use (Table 1).\nEGCG has emerged as a chemopreventive product with anticancer activity for its ability to target several oncogenic signaling pathways and it has been recently tested in various phases of clinical trials [84]. EGCG in the Polyphenon E preparation was well tolerated by patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia in a phase II trial. Durable declines in the total lymphocytic count and lymphadenopathy were observed in the majority of patients [85]. EGCG clinical trials have been conducted targeting postmenopausal women with high risk of developing breast cancer. EGCG can afford benefit in terms of regulating LDL-cholesterol, glucose and insulin, as reported by a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled interventional study in healthy postmenopausal women [86]. A systematic review of the literature for the ability of EGCG to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was performed. Data showed that consumption of green tea EGCG resulted in a significant reduction of LDL-C and the effect size was slightly dependent on the baseline lipid level of the subjects [87]. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial further confirmed the benefit of EGCG on blood lipids in healthy postmenopausal women [88]. Finally, a meta-analysis was done to evaluate the association between green tea intake and risk of cardiovascular diseases or ischemic related diseases. The study provides evidence that consumption of green tea is associated with favorable outcomes [89].\nAll studies did not report significant adverse effects and registered the ability of EGCG/GTE to restore natural homeostasis in many different pathologies. Given their low toxicity risk and the large consumption, EGCG and GTE have potential use as safe natural supplement either for prevention or for treatment of several diseases with inflammation hallmarks.\nIn conclusion, in COVID-19 the EGCG/GTE supplementation should be advantageous because of their multitarget action as regulators of both transcription factor (i.e., STAT1, STAT3, NF-κB, Nrf2) activities and expression of their target genes (Figure 1). EGCG/GTE could restore the tissue homeostasis counteracting the pro-inflammatory action of IFNs and cytokines and the onset of lung fibrosis (Figure 1).\nSepsis is a systemic inflammation syndrome due to a dysregulated host response to bacterial or viral infection, characterized by excessive accumulation of inflammatory mediators and impairment to restore homeostasis. Tissue damage is partially elicited by pathogen- and damage-associated molecular patterns. Among them the high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), that is released by activated monocytes/macrophages and functions as a late mediator of endotoxemia and sepsis, plays a key role [93]. Indeed, mice administration of recombinant HMGB results in clinical signs of sepsis and, conversely, antibodies anti-HMGB1 or its inhibitors protect mice against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute tissue injury and lethal sepsis [93,94]. Instead, selective deletion of IL-1β, IL-1R type 1, IL-18, and inhibitor κB kinase β, as well as, loss of NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), a canonical inflammasome component, fails to promote survival in experimental sepsis or induce severe immunodeficiency [95]. In this context, it should be highlighted the importance of selectively targeting damage-mediated inflammation, specially HMGB1, whilst maintaining the physiological protective immune responses [95].\nIt has been known for a long time that GTE confers protection against lethality in a murine model of endotoxin-induced sepsis [96] and that EGCG administration, (10 mg/kg, i.p.), improves polymicrobial rat sepsis by inhibiting both NF-κB activation and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) expression [97]. Data of Wang et al. recently confirmed a protective effect of 10 mg/kg administration of EGCG in acute LPS-induced lung mice injury, showing an associated reduction of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, Toll-like receptor-4 levels, and NF-κB activation [98]. Importantly, EGCG promoted significant long-lasting protection against experimental sepsis as 4 mg/kg (i.p.) delayed administration of this catechin, i.e., 24 or 48 h after cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), significantly rescued mice from sepsis, thus supporting a therapeutic potential of EGCG in clinical management of human septicemia [99]. Li et al. demonstrated again that EGCG attenuates IL-6 and HMGB1 serum levels in mice after CLP, as well as, 10 µM EGCG reduces the secretion of IL-6, TNF-α and nitric oxide in primary murine peritoneal macrophages that were stimulated with HMGB1 [99]. Finally, a pro-autophagic activity of EGCG (at 2–20 µM range) in an endotoxin stimulated macrophages model was also registered, resulting in autophagic HMGB1 degradation and protection against endotoxemia [100]. Another potential molecular mechanism could explain the EGCG ability to decrease HMGB1 serum level. Notably, JAK/STAT1 may represent a critical signaling mechanism controlling HMGB1 translocation from nucleus to cytoplasm before its secretion [95]. In both lethal endotoxemia and experimental sepsis inhibition of the JAK/STAT1 pathway by genetic deletion of STAT1 [101], or inhibition of IFN-β expression by knockout of IRF3 [102], significantly decrease HMGB1 release and enhance animals survival [95,103]. As already reported above, we demonstrated that EGCG inhibits STAT1 activation both in vitro and in pre-clinical studies [47,50,52,53,54]. Hence, we suggest that the EGCG inhibitory effect on HMGB1 secretion could be mediated by the catechin ability to block STAT1 activity with a consequently hindrance of HMGB1 cytosolic translocation. \nSepsis is a common feature of COVID-19, that is often associated with sepsis-induced coagulopathy leading to disseminated intravascular coagulation and resulting in high related mortality [104]. Importantly, the overproduction in serum of two alarmins S100A8/A9 and HMGB1 in patients with COVID-19 was associated with distinct signatures for cytokine storm. Serum levels of these parameters are of great clinical significance and can be utilized to identify COVID-19 patients with poor outcomes [105]. In agreement with these results, some researchers recently proposed that HMGB1 should be considered a crucial therapeutic target in COVID-19 therapy [106,107].\nTogether, these findings indicate that targeting HMGB1 may be beneficial and that GTE/EGCG can be also useful in both prevention and decrease of sepsis by counteracting its deleterious effects with several mechanisms, as already suggested by Wyganowska-Swiatkowska et al. [108].\nLikewise to their antibacterial properties, green tea polyphenols are known to possess antiviral activities against a wide range of DNA and RNA viruses. Among natural catechins, EGCG was found to be the most potent virus inhibitor and the 3-galloyl and 5′-OH groups appear crucial for this activity [109,110]. In particular, EGCG at the micromolar concentration inhibits the infectivity of herpes simplex virus (HSV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), influenza A virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Zika virus, dengue virus and many others [111]. The broad antiviral properties of EGCG are due to its high affinity but nonspecific binding to viral surface proteins, since EGCG competes with heparan sulfate or sialic acid for virions first attachment [111,112]. The more stable form of EGCG (EGCG-palmitoyl ester) is 8–24 times more effective than native EGCG to block H1N1 influenza virus, Ebola virus and HSV-2, with a long-lasting protective action (up to 48 h) [113]. By the way, EGCG-palmitate is currently used as ingredient in different products for its generalized increase in antimicrobial efficacy [113]. It is worth noting that green tea catechins are effective in prophylaxis for influenza infections in humans, as emerging by clinical trials [114,115], in addition to in vitro results [116]. Thus, EGCG and other green tea polyphenols could be excellent candidates as non-toxic agents that can prevent a broad range of human and animal viral infections [113].\nOn the other hand, green tea catechins can block the virus’ life cycle in infected cells. As it concerns HIV-AIDS, EGCG can prevent HIV replication in human peripheral blood cells in vitro by blocking the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase [117,118]. Additionally, EGCG can downregulate the expression of CD4 receptor and reduce HIV viral DNA-integrase binding [112,119]. Moreover, EGCG inhibits serine protease activity of HCV with IC50 of 8.5 µM [120], as well as, HCV cell-to-cell spread [121].\nIt must also be reminded that FDA has approved Veregen, a catechin-derivative drug, for topical treatment of papilloma virus genital lesions (Food and Drug Administration 2006 http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2006/021902s000TOC.cfm).\nCoronaviruses (CoVs) are positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that infect a wide range of animal hosts. Like SARS and MERS CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 genome contains ORF1a and ORF1ab open reading frames which codify for two peptides required for viral replication cycle [122]. The proteolytic processing of these peptides is one of the crucial steps in the life cycle of CoVs, which encode a papain-like protease and 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3-CLpro) [123,124].\nChen et al. reported that theaflavin-3,3′-digallate, but not EGCG, is an inhibitor of the main SARS-CoV protease 3CLPro, with an IC50 of 7 µM [123]. Instead, Nguyen et al. showed that quercetin, EGCG and gallocatechin gallate (GCG), with IC50 in the 50–80 µM range, displayed inhibitory activity in vitro on the SARS-CoV-3CLpro expressed in Pichia pastoris [125]. Recently, Khan et al. carried out a molecular docking of seven SARS-CoV-2 proteins with 18 hypothetical inhibitors which had been previously recognized to be anti-SARS-CoV agents [126]. The authors reported that EGCG displays a strong molecular interaction with all SARS-CoV-2 proteins tested, including 3CLPro. In this in silico study, EGCG was <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightpink; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">found<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">trials</span>\n</mark> to be even more active than the <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightgreen; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">approved<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">usages</span>\n</mark>  <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightgreen; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">drugs<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">usages</span>\n</mark> for anti-SARS-CoV-2 <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightgreen; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">therapy<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">usages</span>\n</mark>  <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightorange; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">Remdesivir<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">chemical</span>\n</mark> and Chloroquine [126]. Likewise, Bhardwaj et al., by molecular dynamics simulation, reported that other tea extract components, such as oolonghomobisflavan-A, theasinensin-D and theaflavin-3-o-gallate, have higher docking score than the repurposed antiviral drugs, Atanazavir, Lopinavir and Darunavir, used in COVID-19 therapy [127]. Moreover, Lung et al. found that theaflavin, that is derived by catechins oxidation and is principally present in black tea, has a lower binding energy when it docks in the catalytic pocket of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [128]. Finally, Ghosh et al. showed that EGCG, epicatechin gallate and GCG display strong interaction with His41 and/or Cys145 of the catalytic pocket of SARS-CoV-2-3CLPro, so these catechins can be potential 3CLPro inhibitors [129]. In summary, the active molecules present in green tea extract form a greater number of hydrogen bonds than the complexes with repurposed antiviral drugs, suggesting strong interaction and stability with important viral enzymes [127]. Despite high expectations, it should be recalled here that these promising results must be validated in both cell and animal models, before considering green tea polyphenols efficacious anti SARS-CoV-2 agents. Since green tea catechins and, specially, EGCG present no toxicity and good human intestine absorption, these studies give the rational to set up in vitro and in vivo experiments for the development of new antiviral drugs against COVID-19.\nConsidering all the properties and the safety profile of EGCG and/or GTE in human, we can speculate that catechins supplementation will be at least partially effective in controlling the inflammation damages that occur in SARS-CoV-2 infection. It should be reminded that, until now, there is no direct evidence in favor of the hypothesis that EGCG treatment could improve COVID-19 outcome. The limitation of our hypothesis lies on the fact that the results reported in this review come from other infections or diseases with uncontrolled immune activation. Anyway, its effectiveness against COVID-19 should be evaluated. Thus, we propose to set up a clinical trial in COVID-19 using EGCG, in addition to antiviral or other anti-inflammatory drugs, as a multitasked anti-inflammatory agent aimed at limiting exacerbated cytokines release. Taking into account that a timely administration of EGCG to COVID-19 patients is most likely crucial, we suggest administering EGCG, orally, at the dosage of 600–900 mg/die, once the symptoms aggravate and/or the blood C-reactive protein, or other markers of inflammation, increase. We expect that EGCG administration can prevent the further aggravation leading to inflammatory markers decline. Finally, it must be reminded that EGCG treatment should also improve coagulopathy-associated to sepsis and lung fibrosis.</br></br>UNKNOWN URL AND TITLE</br></br>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This virus belongs to the enveloped RNA virus Coronaviridae family with close relation to the other two highly pathogenic members SARS-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which were responsible for the worldwide outbreaks of respiratory diseases in 2002–2003 and 2012, respectively [1–3].\nSARS-CoV-2 contains a single positive-sense RNA strand of approximately 26,000 to 32,000 bases. At the 5’ end, two overlapping ORFs, ORF1a and ORF1b, encode the gene for the replicase complex. The rest of the genome encodes ORFs for accessory proteins and structural proteins including the Spike (S), Envelope (E), Membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Upon SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cell, two polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab are translated from ORF1a and ORF1b, and subsequently cleaved into 16 non-structural proteins (NSPs 1–16) by two proteases, Papain-like protease (NSP3-PLpro), and Main Protease (NSP5-Mpro). Next, the membrane associated replication-transcription complex (RTCs) is assembled from the NSPs containing the key replication enzyme RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NSP12-RdRp) to drive SARS-CoV-2 genome replication, subgenomic transcription, and structural protein synthesis. In addition, the SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes several RNA processing enzymes including NSP16 with 2’-O-ribose methyltransferase (NSP16-2OMT) activity involved in viral RNA 5’-capping and maturation. These evolutionary conserved viral enzymes are essential for virus replication and infectivity [1, 2, 4, 5]. Therefore, tremendous effort has been focused on understanding the structures and functions of SARS-CoV-2 NSPs in viral pathogenesis and targeting them for anti-viral therapy.\nDifferent herbal remedies have been used as preventive recipes, nutritional supplement, and treatment approaches for COVID-19 in several Asian countries and have been shown to effectively reduce virus transmission and attenuate disease progression [6–9]. However, the mechanisms of action for the herbal remedies in anti-viral therapies are not understood. It is noteworthy that many herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine do contain active anti-viral compounds such as glycyrrhizin from liquorice root and have been widely used as key ingredients in recipes for treatment of influenza, hepatitis, and other viral infections [10–12]. Thus, the analyses of the anti-viral ingredients of herbal remedies would lead to more effective development of chemoprophylaxis for prevention and treatment of COVID-19 and other coronavirus infections.\nHere, we report a comprehensive in silico screening and molecular docking study of four essential pathogenic proteins of SARS-CoV-2, including two proteases, NSP3-PLpro and NSP5-Mpro, and two proteins critical for RNA replication and processing, NSP12-RdRp and NSP16-2OMT, using a phytochemical compound library. The top candidates were evaluated and ranked based on their theoretical free energy upon binding to the targeted “druggable” sites. We identified several top candidates including Albanol B and Amentoflavone that were the active ingredients from medicinal herbs with previously shown antiviral effects. This study could serve as a framework for further development of bioactive antiviral natural compounds for COVID-19.\nA database of 33,765 phytochemical compounds was constructed for structural-based virtual screening, which includes 8445 different species from herbs and medicinal plants used in traditional Chinese medicine according to the TCM Database@Taiwan [13], and was cross- referenced using compound ID from Zinc database or Pubchem [14]. Compound structures were converted to pdbqt format using Applied Chemistry Software Openbabel [15].\nVirtual screening was performed using a computer-aided drug screening docking platform powered with Autodock Vina [16, 17]. The screening strategy is outlined in Figure S1 and involves two major steps. In the first step, potential “druggable” pockets were identified on the surface of the target proteins using the automatic surface shape-scanning program PocketPicker [18]. The second step performs computational docking and screening via MGLtools AutoDock Vina to identify the compounds that will bind to the “druggable” pockets. The docking program uses a scoring system to predict the best-bound conformation of the small molecules. The potential energy contributed by the protein–ligand intermodular interactions from the best bound conformations (bound free energy) were optimized to produce the global minimal potential energy of the protein–ligand complex [19, 20]. Four SARS-CoV-2 proteins, NSP3-PLpro, NSP5-Mpro, NSP12-RdRp, and NSP16-2OMT were chosen as target proteins. The individual targeted protein was prepared as described and the virtual screening process was validated for each protein using its complex structure bound with a ligand. After virtual screening, the best binding complexes for each target were selected for further analyses including visual inspection of potential ligand–protein interactions, molecular dynamics simulations and prediction of pharmacokinetic properties.\nThe SARS-CoV-2 core NSP3-PLpro sequence was derived from the NSP3 papain-like proteinase domain, downloaded from the NCBI protein database (protein ID: YP_009725299.1). The SARS-CoV NSP3-PLpro structure (PDB 5E6J_A) was used as template with the SWISS-MODEL online service (https://swissmodel.expasy.org/) to build the initial SARS-CoV-2 NSP3-PLpro structure model. The druggable pocket, predicted with PocketPicker using software PyMOL was located between the predicted ubiquitin binding site and the active site [18, 21]. The docking setup parameters include the following: center for grid box at x = 120, y = 8, z = 288; size for grid box at x = 22, y = 20, z = 18; num_modes = 9. The SARS-CoV-2 NSP3-PLpro structure PDB 7JRN in complex with GRL0617 was used to validate the modeling pocket and the docking process, and PDB 6XAA was used to validate the docking results for the candidate small molecules.\nThe SARS-CoV-2 NSP5-Mpro sequence was downloaded from the NCBI database (protein ID: YP_009725301.1). The SARS-CoV-2 NSP5-Mpro protein structure was downloaded from PDB database (PDB 6LU7_A). The druggable pocket was generated with PocketPicker using the PyMOL software. Virtual screening for NSP5-Mpro was performed with the setup parameters as the following: center for grid box at x = − 12, y = 15, z = 68; size for grid box at x = 20, y = 20, z = 22; num_modes = 9. The modeling pocket and the docking process was validated using SARS-CoV-2 NSP5-Mpro inhibitor N3 (PRD_002214), which was the bound ligand in PDB 6LU7.\nSARS-CoV-2 NSP12-RdRp was downloaded from the NCBI protein database (protein ID: YP_009725307.1). The SARS-CoV NSP12 structure (PDB 6NUR_A) was initially used as the template with the SWISS-MODEL online service to build the SARS-CoV-2 NSP12-RdRp structure model. SARS-CoV-2 NSP12-RdRp ligand-binding pocket was generated with PocketPicker using software PyMOL. Virtual screening for NSP12-RdRp was performed with the setup parameters as the following: center for x = 142, y = 150, z = 155; size for grid box at x = 20, y = 24, z = 20; num_modes = 9. The SARS-CoV-2 NSP12-RdRp structure PDB 7BV2 in complex with <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightorange; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">Remdesivir<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">chemical</span>\n</mark> was <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightgreen; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">used<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">usages</span>\n</mark> to validate the modeling pocket and the docking process, and PDB 6M71 was then used to validate the docking results for the candidate small molecules.\nThe SARS-CoV-2 NSP16-2OMT sequence was downloaded from the NCBI database (protein ID: YP_009725311.1). The SARS-CoV NSP16 protein structure (PDB 3R24_A) was initially used to generate the SARS-CoV-2 NSP16-2OMT protein model with SWISS-MODEL online service. The SARS-CoV-2 NSP16-2OMT ligand-binding pocket was generated with PocketPicker using PyMOL. Two druggable pockets were used for virtual screening. The parameters for pocket one, the S-Adenosylmethionine binding site, were as the following: center for grid box at x = 55, y = 63, z = 65; size for grid box at x = 16, y = 18, z = 14; num_modes = 9. The parameters for pocket two, the RNA-cap-binding groove, were as the following: center for grid box at x = 63, y = 63, z = 55; size for grid box at x = 14, y = 18, z = 18; num_modes = 9. The SARS-CoV-2 NSP16-2OMT structure (PDB 6W4H) was used to validate the modeling pocket and the docking process using the bound ligand SAM, and followed by validation of the docking results for the selected small molecules.\nMolecular dynamics simulation was used to clarify the dynamic behavior of the protein–ligand complexes at an atomic level. The protein–ligand complex structures from covalent docking were submitted to MD simulations using Gromacs 5.0.2 [22]. CHARMM force field for all atoms was chosen to run MD simulation for a time scale of 50 ns. All protein–ligand systems were solvated with three-point transferable intermolecular potential (TIP3P) and their charges were neutralized via adding Na or Cl ions. Energetic minimization of the protein–ligand systems was performed through the steepest descent algorithm at a tolerance value of 1000 kJ mol−1 nm−1, followed by the equilibration with position restraint on the protein molecules for 0.1 ns using NVT and NPT ensembles. Electrostatic interactions were evaluated by Particle Mesh Ewald summation [23].\nSwissADME was used to calculate the Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion (ADME) properties of the candidate compounds [24]. The molecule SMILES file was submitted to SwissADME (http://www.swissadme.ch) to calculate grouped parameters to evaluate physicochemical properties, lipophilicity, pharmacokinetics, and drug-likeness. The candidate compound physicochemical properties were represented by the chemical formula, Molecular Weight (MW), the counts of specific atoms (H-bond acceptors and H-bond donors), and Topological Polar Surface Area (TPSA). Lipophilicity was represented by the predicted partition coefficient between n-octanol and water (LOGPo/w). Water solubility was represented by LOGS, the decimal logarithm of the molar solubility in water. SwissADME also provided qualitative solubility classes (soluble, moderately soluble, poorly soluble, and insoluble) describing general water solubility of a particular compound. The pharmacokinetic properties were represented by the skin permeability coefficient (Kp), passive human gastrointestinal absorption, and blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeation. Other pharmacokinetic parameters included substrates or non-substrates of the permeability glycoprotein (P-gp) and cytochromes P450 five major isoforms (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4). Bioavailability was used to predict the oral bioavailability of a compound. Drug-likeness was used to assess the probability of a molecule to become an oral drug (0 to1, least probable to most probable), commonly evaluated by the Lipinski filter [19].\nThe NSP3-PLpro is one of the two essential proteases used by SARS-CoV-2 virus to generate NSP 1–4 as part of the viral replication complex from the initial polyproteins translated from viral RNA. NSP3-PLpro is a multifunctional enzyme, carrying viral protease activity as well as deubiquitinase and deISGylation activity for antagonization of the host cell antiviral immune response and promotion of viral replication [21, 26–28]. It is indispensable for SARS-CoV-2 infection and viral replication, thus making it an ideal target for screening of bioactive compounds.\nThe sequence alignment of SARS-CoV NSP3-PLpro and SARS-CoV-2 NSP3-PLpro (protein ID: YP_009725299.1) revealed that these two proteins share 83% sequence identity and over 90% similarity (Figure S2). The catalytic active site including the catalytic triad Cys112/His273/Asp287 (PDB 5E6J) and the substrate “LXGG” peptide recognition sequence are completely conserved (Figure S2) [27, 29]. Surface examination of SARS-CoV-2 NSP3-PLpro revealed an elongated and shallow groove located between the “Thumb” and “Palm” domain spanning the substrate “LXGG” peptide entry point with the finger domain on the left and the catalytic triad on the right (Fig. 2A). The substrate-binding loop (residues 382GNYQCG387), also known as the BL2 loop of SARS-CoV NSP3-PLpro (PDB 5E6J), is comprised of a β-turn, acting as a gatekeeper shaping the substrate-binding groove [29]. This groove was then selected for in silico screening attributing to its importance in NSP3-PLpro substrate recognition and cleavage, which has been targeted by a group of naphthalene inhibitors [27, 30, 31].\nAmong the top ranked candidate compounds, the small molecule Glycobismine F from the herb Glycosmis pentaphylla was identified, which fits the substrate-binding pocket with affinity-free energy of − 9.6 kcal/mol in the initial NSP3-PLpro model built by SARS-CoV and -9.6 kcal/mol using SARS-CoV-2 NSP3-PLpro (PDB 6XAA) (Fig. 2B). Glycobismine F occupies the same space as the previous identified NSP3-PLpro naphthalene inhibitor compound 24 (PDB 3E9S) and compound 3 k and 3j (PDB 4OW0 and 4OVZ). Glycobismine F was found to form multiple contacts with NSP3-PLpro including Tyr384 and Gln385 from the substrate-binding loop (BL2) by H-bond, π–π, and van der Waals interactions. To further predict the behavior of NSP3-PLpro binding by Glycobismine F, MD simulation was performed on NSP3-PLpro complexed with Glycobismine F for 50 ns (Fig. S5). Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) was calculated for NSP3-PLpro and Glycobismine F, respectively, over the course of MD simulation (Fig. S5E, F). MD analysis confirmed the stability of the protein–ligand complex, indicated by the low RMSD values observed for NSP3-PLpro and Glycobismine F around 0.2 nm throughout the course of the MD run. MD analysis further showed Glycobismine F interaction with the BL2 loop residues Tyr384 and Tyr389, occupying the same surface as the naphthalene inhibitors (Fig. S5). This particular space used by Glycobismine F and the naphthalene inhibitors were shown to be unique for SARS-CoV PLpro, as the naphthalene inhibitors that bound to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 NSP3-PLpro showed no or much lower inhibitory potency towards MERS-CoV PLpro and other viral proteases such as HCoV-NL63 PLP2 [32]. Local protein mobility of NSP3-PLpro bound to Glycobismine F was evaluated by measuring residue time-averaged RMSF values on 50 ns trajectory data (Fig. S5G). The NSP3-PLpro residues bound to Glycobismine F showed less atomic fluctuation, suggesting that binding of Glycobismine F favors a more stable conformation.\nA list of top ten compounds from NSP3-PLpro screening is summarized in Supplemental Table S1. Three promising compounds identified with high affinity free energy of − 9.3 kcal/mol include Albanol B, Mahuangnin A, and Rheidin B found in herbs Morus alba L., Murraya microphylla, and Rheum palmatum, respectively (Fig. 2C–E). Molecular docking of these ten compounds to the structure of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro (PDB 6XAA) showed comparable binding free energy, further supporting the highly conserved nature of this substrate-binding site of PLpro between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.\nThe SARS-CoV-2 main protease NSP5-Mpro, also referred to as 3CLPro, is a chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease. As the second key protease for viral polyprotein processing, it is responsible for releasing the rest of the replication complex subunit proteins (NSP 4–16). Therefore, NSP5-Mpro is an essential enzyme for SARS-CoV-2 viral function and is a critical drug target [33–38].\nRecently published SARS-CoV-2 NSP5-Mpro crystal structures as apo protein (PDB 6M2Q) or in complex with the putative inhibitors (PDB 6LU7 and 6M2N) revealed that its overall structure consists of two β-barrel domains (domain I and II) and a helical bundle domain (domain III) [39]. The highly conserved substrate-binding site and the juxtaposed catalytic dyad with the signified residues Cys145 and His41 were identical to the previously reported SARS-CoV Mpro and MERS-CoV Mpro (Fig. 3A) [38, 40–42]. Surface analysis of SARS-CoV-2 NSP5-Mpro (PDB 6LU7) showed that the substrate-recognition pocket was located between the two β-barrel domains (domain I and II) responsible for anchoring the substrate peptide P2-Leu-P1-Gln↓(Ser, Ala, or Gly). NSP5-Mpro residues Asn142 and His163 form contacts with the substrate P1-Gln, and Met165 binds to the P2-Leu of the substrate [39]. Since this pocket conveys substrate recognition and specificity for SARS-CoV-2 NSP5-Mpro, it was used as a targeting site for this in silico screening.\nAmong the top ranked candidate compounds, 5,4-dihydroxyflavone-6-c-beta-glycosylrhamnoside-7-o-glycoside (DBGG) from the herb Glycyrrhiza yunnanensis (licorice root) was found to be deeply inserted into the substrate-binding pocket with affinity free energy of − 9.9 kcal/mol (Fig. 3B). This glycosyloxyflavone molecule forms multiple contacts with NSP5-Mpro including H-bonding with Asn142, His163, and the catalytic residue Cys145 at substrate P1 site as well as a hydrophobic interaction with Met165 at substrate P2 site. MD simulation was then performed on NSP5-Mpro bound to DBGG (Fig. S6) for 50 ns to study the potential interaction dynamics. RMSDs of NSP5-Mpro and DBGG revealed that the complex became stable after 25 ns of the MD run and finished with 0.18 nm for NSP5-Mpro and 0.43 nm for DBGG. RMSF of NSP5-Mpro bound to DBGG showed very small fluctuations throughout the structure, suggesting stable complex formation between DBGG and NSP5-Mpro. Analysis of the final computed NSP5-Mpro:DBGG complex confirmed the interaction of DBGG with NSP5-Mpro substrate-recognition pocket including residues Asn142 and Met165. As these contacts are critical in substrate binding and cleavage, this glycosyloxyflavone molecule is expected to affect NSP5-Mpro by steric hinderance of the active site.\nA list of best-fitting compounds including DBGG for NSP5-Mpro was summarized in Supplementary Table S2. Among them, Ustilaginoidin A from Cldonia alpestris Rabht, Bijaponicaxanthone from Hypericum japonicum Thunb, and Amentoflavone from Ginkgo biloba (Fig. 3C-E) showed affinity free energy ranging from − 10.4 to − 10 kcal/mol and appeared to be better candidates than DBGG. However, closer examination of these three compounds revealed that they did not have contacts with key catalytic or substrate binding residues as DBGG. Amentoflavone has been previously reported to inhibit SARS-CoV Mpro [43, 44]. Further experimental validation of these candidate compounds will reveal their inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 NSP5-Mpro.\nSARS-CoV-2 is a positive strand RNA virus that relies on multi-subunit RNA synthesis machinery for genome replication and gene transcription. The core of its RNA replication complex is RdRp, produced from NSP12, one of the 16 cleavage products of the polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab. NSP12-RdRp is essential for SARS-CoV-2 replication and infection, therefore making it another desirable target for drug development [5].\nThe sequence alignment of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 NSP12-RdRp (protein ID: YP_009725307.1) revealed that these two proteins share 96% sequence identity and over 98% similarity (Fig. S3). The 3D structure of SAR-CoV NSP12-RdRp (PDB 6NUR chain A) was used as an initial template to build the SARS-CoV-2 NSP12-RdRp structure homology model by SWISS-MODEL used for in silico screening [45]. While the manuscript was in preparation, the EM structures of SARS-CoV-2 NSP12-RdRp in complex with co-factors were released (PDB 7BTF, 6M71, and 7BV2) [46]. Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 NSP12-RdRp with SARS-CoV NSP12-RdRp revealed RMSD of 0.4–0.6 Å over 931 NSP12-RdRp backbone Cα atoms with most differences located in the N-terminal NiRAN domain, whereas the core RNA polymerase domains (residues 366–920) remained highly conserved and almost identical. A large cup-shaped space could be found in the core RNA polymerase domains formed by the finger, palm, and thumb subdomains, containing the conserved Motif A-G for coordinating template and NTP for polymerization at the catalytic active site (Fig. 4A). A groove corresponding to NTP channel and the active site was selected as a targeting pocket for in silico screening, as is for the NSP12-RdRp inhibitor Remdisivir [46] (Fig. 4A).\nAmentoflavone was identified to interact with NSP12-RdRp. It could fit into the selected pocket with affinity free energy of − 9.5 kcal/mol in the initial model built by SARS-CoV NSP12-RdRp (PDB 6NUR) and -9.7 kcal/mol using SARS-CoV-2 NSP12-RdRp (PDB 7BTF). As shown in Fig. 4B, Amentoflavone was inserted deep into the NTP pocket at the active site, forming H-bonds with the NTP coordinating residues Arg553 and Arg555 of Motif F, coordinating the active site residues Thr680, Ala685, Thr687, and Ala688 from Motif B, and also making π–cation interaction with R624 from Motif A. MD simulation was then performed on NSP12-RdRp bound to Amentoflavone (Fig. S7) for 50 ns to study the interaction dynamics. The complex became stable after 20 ns with the RMSD value for NSP12-RdRp stabilized at 0.25 nm and Amentoflavone at 0.2 nm. RMSF of NSP12-RdRp showed very small fluctuations around the Amentoflavone binding region (Residues 550—700), suggesting stable complex formation between Amentoflavone and NSP12-RdRp. MD analysis of Amentoflavone confirmed its interaction with the selected binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 NSP12-RdRp, involving the residues Asp623 from Motif A, the residues Asp683, Ala685, Ala688 from Motif B and the residue Arg555 from Motif F (Fig. S7). As these contacts are critical for binding NTP and catalysis, Amentoflavone is expected to affect SARS-CoV2 NSP12-RdRp RNA polymerase activity by steric interference.\nAmong the top-ranked candidate compounds, Astrachrysoside from Astragalus chrysopterus, Mulbellofuran M from Morus alba L., and Ergocristine found in Claviceps purpurea (Fr.) Tul (Fig. 4C–E) appeared to fit in the targeted binding pocket better than Amentoflavone in the initial model with affinity free energy ranging from − 10.7 to − 9.6 kcal/mol. However, when validated with SARS-CoV-2 NSP12-RdRp (PDB 7BTF), these three compounds showed less binding affinity with SARS-CoV-2 NSP12-RdRp with free energy values ranging from − 8.2 to − 7.8 kcal/mol, suggesting the slight conformational difference of the active site between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 NSP12-RdRp. The information of these top-ranked candidate compounds for NSP12-RdRp and their binding affinity free energy values were summarized in Supplemental Table S3.\nSARS-CoV-2 NSP16-2OMT is one of the evolutionary conserved RNA processing enzymes encoded by SARS-CoV-2, responsible for viral mRNA capping. This enzyme catalyzes the last step of the viral RNA 5’-cap synthesis, converting Me7GpppN (cap 0 structure) to Me7GpppN-2O-Me (cap 1 structure) in S-adenosylmethione (SAM) dependent manner. SARS-CoV-2 NSP16-2OMT is essential for protecting viral mRNA from degradation and preventing it from being recognized by the host innate immune response [47]. Recent research has shown that the SARS virus with NSP16-2OMT mutations attenuated viral pathogenesis [48]. Thus, inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 NSP16-2OMT could intervene in viral RNA 2’-O-Methylation, promoting host immune defense and viral clearance.\nThe sequence alignment of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 NSP16-2OMT (protein ID: YP_009725311.1) revealed that these two proteins share 93% sequence identity and 97% similarity (Fig. S4). The 3D structure of SARS-CoV NSP16-2OMT (PDB 3R24 chain A) was used as an initial template to build the SARS-CoV-2 NSP16-2OMT structure homology model by SWISS-MODEL used for in silico screening [49]. The crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 NSP16-2OMT in complex with NSP10 (PDB 6W4H, 6W61 and 6W75) were released while this manuscript was in preparation. Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 NSP16-2OMT (PDB 3R24 chain A) with SARS-CoV NSP16-2OMT (PDB 6W4H chain A) revealed the RMSD value of 0.24 Å over the backbone 294 Cα atoms of the structured region of the two NSP16s, whereas the SAM-binding and the active sites were mostly identical. A large “V” shaped space was found at the center of NSP16-2OMT. Within this space, the SAM binding cleft was formed by three loops depicted as SAM-L1, L2, and L3 on the right, the RNA-Cap groove on the left, and the catalytic residues Lys46, Asp130, Lys170, and Glu203 joining the SAM and RNA-Cap groove as a continuous channel [49] (Fig. 5A). Two runs of in silico screening were performed, the first run targeting the SAM-binding cleft and the second run focusing on the RNA-Cap groove. The top hit candidate compounds were then validated with the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 NSP16-2OMT (PDB 6W4H).\nIn the virtual screening of SARS-CoV-2 NSP16-2OMT using the SAM-binding cleft, two structurally similar biflavonoid compounds Dihydroochnaflavone and Ochnaflavone were identified, with respective affinity free energy of − 10.8 kcal/mol and − 10.5 kcal/mol in the initial model, and − 10.4 kcal/mol and -10.1 kcal/mol in SARS-CoV-2 NSP16-2OMT (PDB 6W4H). As shown in Fig. 5B, Ochnaflavone fits into the SAM-binding groove, with one flavone ring forming H-bond and hydrophobic interactions with the residue Leu100 from SAM-L1 and the Met131 and Asp133 from SAM-L3, and the other flavone ring forming contacts with the catalytic residues Lys170 and Glu 203. MD simulation was performed on NSP16-2OMT bound to Ochnaflavone (Fig. S8) for 50 ns to explore the interaction dynamics. The NSP16-2OMT RMSD value was stabilized at 0.2 nm after 10 ns and the RMSD for the ligand Ochnaflavone was stabilized at 0.4 nm. RMSF of NSP16-2OMT showed atomic fluctuations (0.05–0.1 nm) around the binding region of Ochnaflavone (Residues 99–132 and 170–203), suggesting stable complex formation between NSP16-2OMT and Ochnaflavone. MD analysis of Ochnaflavone confirmed its interaction with the SAM-binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 NSP16-2OMT including the residues Leu100, Met131 and Tyr132 (Fig. S8). As these residues are critical for NSP16-2OMT binding SAM, Ochnaflavone is expected to affect SARS-CoV2 NSP16-2OMT activity by steric interference.\nAs for the RNA-Cap binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 NSP16-2OMT, Trichotomine from Clerodendron trichotomum was found to be the best scored compound with affinity free energy of − 10 kcal/mol. Trichotomine occupies the active site of NSP16-2OMT and extends toward the RNA-Cap entry site, forming contacts with the catalytic residues Lys170 and Glu203, as well as the key SAM/RNA-Cap binding residue Tyr132 (Fig. 5D). Importantly, as mutation of any of the catalytic residues or Tyr132 resulted in catalytically dead enzyme, both Ochnaflavone and Trichotomine are expected to block NSP16-2OMT enzymatic activities [49].\nAdditional candidate compounds for NSP16-2OMT include Epicatechin-(2b- > 7,4b- > 6)-catechin from Arachis hypogaea L. and Mulberrofuran K from Morus alba, which also have promising docking results (Fig. 5C, E, Supplemental Table S4). Epicatechin-(2b- > 7,4b- > 6)-catechin binds to the SAM binding site with affinity free energy of − 11.1 kcal/mol, whereas affinity free energy for Mulberrofuran K interaction with the RNA-Cap binding site appeared to be − 10.2 kcal/mol.\nIt is well known that an effective medicine not only needs to possess biological efficacy, but also good pharmacokinetic features, i.e. ability of a compound to reach therapeutic concentration in the organism. In this context, computer models were used to predict and evaluate the potential properties of a candidate compound in absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion, referred as ADME, as an alternative approach to assist drug discovery and development. SwissADME was used to predict the physiochemical and pharmacokinetic properties of the identified candidate inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 enzymes (Table 1, Supplementary Tables S5–S8). Among the top hits for SARS-CoV-2 enzymes, Glycobismine F, Amentoflavone, and Ochnaflavone presented high lipophilicity and low water solubility, while DBGG was predicted as a water-soluble molecule. All four compounds showed low skin permeability, low GI absorption, and no BBB permeation.\nThe pharmacokinetic relevant protein Permeability glycoprotein (P-gp) and cytochromes P450 (CYP) are the key drug metabolic enzymes. As inhibition of these enzymes is one major cause of drug toxicity and side effects due to low clearance, it is important to predict the compounds’ propensity of interaction with these pharmacokinetic relevant proteins. As shown in Table 1, Glycobismine F and Amentoflavone were not substrates or inhibitors of P-gp and CYP. DBGG was predicted to be the substrate of P-gp, whereas Ochnaflavone was shown to inhibit CYP isoform CYP2C9. Last, drug-likeness of the candidate compounds was evaluated by the probability of a molecule becoming an oral drug using the Lipinski filter (Pfizer) and Abbot bioavailability score [19]. Only Ochnaflavone met the Lipinski’s rules and showed properties of a good oral drug, while the other three were predicted as poor oral drug candidates.\nThe economic and public health challenges that we are currently facing with the COVID-19 pandemic are unprecedented, resulting in unmet medical needs for effective therapeutics and prophylactic strategies to respond to the current and future outbreaks [50, 51]. Due to the fast evolving and heterologous nature of SARS coronavirus, inhibitors selectively targeting a single SARS-CoV-2 protein could be an untenable solution in the near term [52, 53]. On the other hand, in silico screening could provide a cost-effective method to identify bioactive molecules from different compound sources. A combination approach such as targeting multiple pathogenic pathways and viral proteins may represent a better strategy against the current virus outbreaks [54]. In this study, we performed in silico screening targeting four critical SARS-CoV-2 viral enzymes, NSP3-PLpro, NSP5-Mpro, NSP12-RdRp, and NSP16-2OMT, aiming to provide a pool of natural compounds with potential for attenuation of pathologic virulence of SARS-CoV-2 and prevention of COVID-19 infection.\nTo identify the potential inhibitors of these four SARS-CoV-2 viral enzymes, we targeted the primary substrate binding sites or active sites through in silico screening, as these sites are highly conserved and indispensable for the SARS-CoV-2 viral replication and function. An expanded library of 33,765 phytochemicals containing collections from TCM Database and bioactive compounds from herbs and medicinal plants was used to search for SARS-CoV-2 viral inhibitors [13]. Interestingly, several small molecules identified presented more than one potential viral targets (Supplemental Table S9). One such compound is Amentoflavone, a biflavonoid that is found particularly enriched in Ginkgo biloba and Hypericum perforatum. Amentoflavone was previously shown to be an inhibitor of cathepsin B, a lysosomal cysteine protease, and an antiviral agent against respiratory syncytial virus [55, 56]. Using virtual screening, we found that Amentoflavone could potentially inhibit both SARS-CoV-2 NSP-Mpro and NSP12-RdRp. In addition, the small molecule Albanol B was found to have affinity for both SARS-CoV-2 NSP3-PLpro and NSP12-RdRp. Although there was no direct evidence for its antiviral effect, Albanol B extracted from Mulberry (Morus alba L.) root bark was reported have an anti-inflammatory effect [57]. Thus, these small molecules could be promising antiviral compounds inhibiting multiple steps of the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2.\nFurthermore, we summarized the potential active compounds identified in this study, which could be found in the herbs and medicinal plants from the herbal recipes recommended for COVID-19 prevention or treatment (Table 2 and Supplemental Table S10) [6, 8, 9, 58–60]. Notably, Mulberry root bark (Morus alba\nL., SANG BAI PI) and Licorice root (Glycyrrhiza uralensis, GAN CAO) appear to be the most popular herb ingredients used in herbal remedies against COVID-19, with potential active compounds affecting the activities of PLpro, Mpro, RdRp, and 2OMT, respectively. Licorice is one of the ancient remedy ingredients used for hepatitis and respiratory tract viral infection, currently under clinical trial as an antiviral therapy for COVID-19 infection [10–12]. Other active compounds identified from our study were found from popular medicinal herb and plant sources, including Ephedra (Herba ephedrae, MA HUANG), Agastache herb (Agastache rugosa, HUO XIANG), Honeysuckle Flower (Lonicera japonica, JING YIN HUA), Ginger (Zingiber officinale, JIANG), Milkvetch Root (Astragalus mongholicus Bunge, HUANG QI), Rhubarb root (Rheum officinale Baill. DA HUANG), Indigowoad Root (lsatis indigotica, BAN LAN GENG), and Fritillary bulb (Fritillaria thunbergii, BEI MU). Many of these ingredients have been historically used to treat respiratory viral infection [61, 62]. Similar remedies have shown benefits in combating SARS in 2003 [8, 9]. They may present novel antiviral effects against COVID-19 through inhibiting key enzymes of SARS-CoV-2. Optimization of these identified phytochemical compounds could lead to the discovery of more effective antiviral compounds and more powerful plant-based remedies targeting SARS-CoV-2.</br></br>UNKNOWN URL AND TITLE</br></br>In December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia cases of unknown origin, epidemiologically linked to the attendance of Wuhan Central Marketplace in Hubei province in China, was reported for the first time. The aetiological agent of this novel pneumonia has been named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the name 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been coined for the disease itself. Due to the rapid spread of the infection across all the continents, a pandemic emergency has been declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020.\nSARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, non-segmented, positive-sense single-stranded ribonucleic-acid (RNA) β-coronavirus, which shares 80% sequence homology with SARS-CoV-1 and 50% sequence homology with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV. Like SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 cell entry depends on binding of the viral spike protein to Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor of lower respiratory tract cells and on spike protein priming by the trans-membrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2).\nEven if the majority of infected people develops smooth symptoms, a considerable number progresses to pneumonia with severe respiratory failure requiring hospitalization, and a minority develops life-threatening complications with poor prognosis. Older age and comorbidities (mainly arterial hypertension, followed by diabetes and ischemic heart disease) are the most significant risk factors associated with the worst outcomes [1]. To date, no specific therapy against COVID-19 disease exists; many trials are ongoing with different treatment options but further time will be necessary to develop an effective therapy.\nCOVID-19 disease’s clinical course can be divided into three phases. The first one, the “viraemic phase”, is characterized by fast viral replication and symptoms are caused by direct cytopathic effect. This phase lasts 7–8 days and is accompanied by mild and often non-specific symptoms, such as fever, malaise, myalgia, headache, dry cough, conjunctival congestion, anosmia and ageusia, abdominal pain and diarrhoea. In patients who are able to control the infection, prognosis and recovery are excellent. The second phase, named “acute or pneumonia phase”, generally occurs after 7–8 days from the symptoms onset and is characterized by high fever, cough and dyspnoea, requiring close observation and management. At this stage, patients develop a frank viral pneumonia, with imaging showing bilateral infiltrates or ground-glass opacities, and blood tests revealing lymphocytopenia and increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. The patient’s immune system begins to develop a reaction that, if balanced, leads to the final healing, if exaggerated, brings to the “phase of complications”. This third phase, which is experienced by a minority of COVID-19 patients, is characterized by extrapulmonary systemic hyperinflammatory syndrome, also referred to as cytokine storm, due to an over-reaction of the immune system with over-production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other mediators [1, 2]. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the most frequent complication (20% of the patients) followed by acute heart failure, acute kidney injury (AKI), liver failure, shock, secondary bacterial infections, coagulopathies and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Notably, 20% of COVID-19 patients, and nearly 100% of the critical ones, develop coagulation disorders, in particular a hypercoagulable state which predisposes to DIC. Indeed, micro- and macro-thrombi in lungs and extrapulmonary districts have been described in several autopsy series, suggesting that thrombosis and inflammation are two processes that reinforce each other in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 complications [3].\nSeveral innate immune signalling proteins are targeted by SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins, among all, Interferon (IFN) and Nf-Kb pathways. In particular, SARS-CoV-2 seems to be able to activate NLRP3 (NOD like receptor pyrin domain-containing 3) inflammasome causing the abnormal production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The cytokine storm is induced by the activation of large numbers of white blood cells, including B cells, T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, monocytes, and resident tissue cells, such as epithelial and endothelial cells, which release high amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Among the numerous molecules that increase in serum in a cytokine storm, complements, IFN-γ, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-12, and IL-17, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) are of crucial importance. An Italian study found an increased capability of cluster of differentiation (CD)4 + or CD8 + T cells from COVID-19 patients with pneumonia to produce in vitro IL-17, that is able to strengthen the inflammation response and to activate neutrophils [4]. Pathway analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells transcriptome revealed that COVID-19 patients lymphopenia may be associated with activation of apoptosis and P53 signalling pathway in lymphocytes, in which SARS-CoV-2 seems to enter through the CD147 receptor. Virus-activated “cytokine storm syndrome” is a common feature of severe COVID-19 cases, a major reason for ARDS and multiorgan failure, and the main cause of mortality in COVID-19 disease [5].\nUnderstanding COVID-19 disease pathogenesis is important to make the best treatment choices. For instance, antiviral drugs are likely more useful in the phases ruled by the direct cytopathic effect of SARS-CoV-2; whereas, at the later stages of COVID-19 disease, the treatment options to be theoretically considered more appropriate would be the ones which affect the immune response, such as corticosteroids and immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory agents [1, 2]. However, the pathogenic features of COVID-19 disease are yet far from being completely elucidated and no validated specific therapeutic options exist.\nThis paper intends to review COVID-19 treatment options which are currently under investigation. For each drug deemed to be potentially effective on COVID-19 disease, firstly we discuss the putative mechanisms by which the drug may act against SARS-CoV-2 or may affect COVID-19 pathogenesis, then we comment on the major clinical studies among COVID-19 patients involving the particular drug.\nAll the relevant studies were independently retrieved by two researchers by interrogating Pubmed and Google Scholar databases, using the following search strategies: “COVID-19 Treatment OR Therapy” and each single drug under investigation for COVID-19 treatment; attention has been paid to “cytokine storm in COVID-19” and “coagulation and COVID-19”. The bibliographic research has been conducted until July 24, 2020.\nLopinavir is a protease inhibitor used for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. Lopinavir binds HIV protease and prevents the Gag/Pol polyprotein cleavage with the consequent production of immature non-infectious viral particles. Ritonavir enhances lopinavir plasmatic concentration by inhibiting cytochrome P450 3A isoform. The drug demonstrated inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in vitro and in animal models. Moreover, a 2004 open-label study showed that the association LPV/r with ribavirin compared to ribavirin alone had a positive effect on ARDS development and mortality in patients with SARS-CoV severe pneumonia [6]. On this basis, LPV/r has been tested since the beginning of the pandemic. As shown in Table 1-LPN/r section, the studies on LPV/r carried out up to now present several criticisms, notably including small samples sizes and poor study design. Nevertheless, it is interesting to observe that in the single available randomized controlled clinical trial LPV/r therapy has not proven effectiveness in patients with severe disease and was not superior to standard therapy when started 12 days or later after symptoms onset. In the few studies evaluating LPN/r in association with other drugs, such as Umifenovir, Ribavirin and Interferons, combination therapies seem to perform better than LPN/r alone [6–9]. Further studies with a better study design on larger populations are urgently needed to establish if LPN/r could be an effective therapeutic option for COVID-19 disease and to evaluate the appropriate timing of administration of this drug.\nDarunavir is a second-generation protease inhibitor used for HIV therapy. It is associated with cobicistat, which increases its plasma concentration by inhibiting cytochrome P450 3A4 isoform. DAR/COB is an alternative to treatment with LPV/r when the latter is not tolerated because of intestinal side effects [10].

The main studies are reported in Table 1-Remdesivir section.\nFavipiravir is a new generation RdRp inhibitor active against a wide range of viruses. Its use, which is hampered by significant side effects (teratogenicity and suicide induction), is authorized in Japan, but not in Europe and USA, for influenza treatment when other antivirals are not effective [19]. Several studies with Favipiravir among COVID-19 patients have been authorized by regulatory agencies, many of which are still ongoing [20]. The available clinical trials are based on small populations, are not randomized and not double-blinded. Moreover, groups features were heterogeneous, making it hard to draw conclusions on its effect on COVID-19 disease. In the two studies reported in Table 1—Favipiravir section, it seemed slightly more effective than LPN/r and Umifenovir in improving imaging, viral clearance and clinical signs [19, 21].\nUmifenovir is a small indole-derived molecule developed in Russia and approved in Russia and China for prophylaxis and treatment of influenza and other respiratory viral infections. It is able to block viral fusion with the cell membrane in Influenza A and B viruses. Umifenovir and its derivate Umifenovir mesylate had been reported to have antiviral activity against SARS-CoV in cell cultures [22]. A retrospective study based on a small population of patients affected by moderate and severe COVID-19 disease failed to observe significant differences in viral clearance and symptoms resolution between Umifenovir and standard therapy [23]. The limited evidence regarding the use of this drug on COVID-19 patients makes it impossible to draw conclusions.\nCQ and HCQ are used as antimalarial drugs. However, they have a very broad spectrum of action being effective against bacteria, fungi, protozoa and viruses. HCQ safety profile is better than that of CQ, therefore the former should be preferred as it gives the possibility to maintain higher doses for a longer time. CQ and HCQ are effective in vitro against diverse RNA and DNA viruses and inhibit in vitro replication of SARS-CoV229E in lung epithelial cells. CQ and HCQ have multiple mechanisms of action. Firstly, they are able to interfere with cell surface receptors. Specifically, HCQ inhibits sialic acid synthesis. Sialic acid is a monosaccharide located at the end of the sugar chains bound to transmembrane signaling proteins and is a critical component for ligand recognition. Avoiding this fundamental path, the drug interferes with the virus entry. Moreover, these drugs affect cell receptor glycosylation. In SARS-CoV in vitro studies, HCQ glycosylates ACE-2 receptor resulting in failure of recognition, binding and entry of the virus in the cell. HCQ also alkalizes the lysosomal pH. To facilitate the fusion of the virion with the cell, the lysosomal pH should be acid; an alkaline pH inhibits this path. Finally, HCQ can increase the intracellular pH and inhibit lysosomal activity in antigen-presenting cells preventing antigen processing and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II autoantigen presentation to T cells. As a consequence, the drug reduces T cell’s activation, differentiation and expression of co-stimulatory proteins e.g. CD154 on CD4 + T cells and cytokines production from T and B cells (IL-1, IL-6 and TNF). Even the production of type I Interferons is attenuated [24].\nSeveral studies have been performed to assess the efficacy of these molecules on COVID-19 patients and many other studies are still ongoing (see Table 2—CQ/HCQ section). Notably, CQ and HCQ have been included in the Guidelines for the Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Pneumonia Caused by SARS-CoV2 in China [25]. However, the results of CQ and HCQ for COVID-19 treatment are contradictory; some studies showed a clinically significant improvement in patients treated with CQ or HCQ with respect to untreated patients, while others did not show differences between the groups [25–33]. A group of French investigators tested the efficacy of HCQ in association with Azithromycin in mild-moderate COVID-19 patients soon after symptoms onset, in two different studies, showing a clear effectiveness of the above-cited molecules compared with standard therapy [26, 27]. The first study was severely criticized due to design faults and incomplete data [26]; the second one, even if followed by a detailed analysis, still had a small sample size [27]. A larger French clinical trial on a population of 1061 COVID-19 patients confirmed clinical improvement and faster viral clearance in patients treated with HCQ and Azithromycin. It should be highlighted that this study only enrolled patients with mild/moderate disease or asymptomatic subjects with a positive swab; moreover, treatment was started very early after symptoms onset [28]. After these studies, many others showed no clear benefits of HCQ and CQ therapy in COVID-19 patients. Some trials on small populations of severe hospitalized COVID-19 patients even showed an increased mortality in HCQ and CQ treated patients compared to untreated groups [29–33]. However, it is very difficult to draw definite conclusions since study design and heterogeneous populations were some of the many drawbacks of these studies. Recently, a multinational registry analysis on 96,032 severe/critical hospitalized COVID-19 patients was very welcomed by the scientific community since it was thought that a study on such a large population could be diriment and conclusive in understanding the real effectiveness of these two drugs. This analysis not only showed that HCQ and CQ alone and associated with macrolides were not effective in COVID-19 disease, but also that they determined an increased rate of cardiac side effects and an increased mortality rate, depicting an unsettling scenario on these drugs related to toxicity and danger [33]. The publication of this analysis was rapidly followed by the discontinuation of ongoing trials and by the prohibition of HCQ and CQ administration in COVID-19 disease patients by national regulatory agencies and WHO [34]. In a little time, many criticisms were raised against this trial, due to conflicting and missing data and doubts about veracity and accuracy of data collection; as a result, an investigation has been initiated and the study has been withdrawn [35]. Up to now, little can be affirmed with certainty from studies on HCQ and CQ; nevertheless, it seems that these molecules could be effective if administered early after symptoms onset. Further studies with a strong design and a large population need to be performed to understand the real effectiveness of these drugs in early disease stages. Recently, a clinical trial on HCQ used as prophylaxis of COVID-19 disease did not show differences between HCQ and placebo groups in preventing COVID-19 disease after a high-risk exposure [36]. Further studies are needed to understand if HCQ and CQ could be useful as pre-exposure prophylaxis in subjects at high risk (hospital staff, partners of COVID-19 positive patients, etc.).\nCorticosteroids were largely used during SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics. During SARS-CoV epidemic in 2003, systemic glucocorticoids, even at a very high dosage (> 500 mg of methylprednisolone (MTP)/day), were widely used in infected patients who developed severe respiratory disease. A cohort study during SARS-CoV outbreak showed that the use of pulsed high-dose MTP was associated with clinical improvement; however, a previous retrospective study found that the use of pulsed steroids in severe SARS-CoV pneumonia patients was associated with higher 30-day mortality. A systematic review and meta-analysis on the use of corticosteroids in hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia observed a reduction in mortality and need for mechanical ventilation in treated patients. However, a study on MERS-CoV pneumonia stated that the use of steroids was associated with a delayed viral clearance [37]. Against this background, WHO and the Center for Disease Control and prevention (CDC) did not recommend the administration of steroids in COVID-19 disease, at least not in the first disease phases [38]. A Chinese consensus conference proposed to use a low-medium steroid dosage (0.5–1 mg/kg/day of MTP) for 7 days, in patients with acute inflammatory response and dyspnoea [37]. Another Chinese group recommended MTP dosage of 40–80 mg/day (to be gradually reduced) in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and 80–160 mg/day (to be gradually reduced) in critical patients [39]. On the one hand, steroids have an immunosuppressive activity that determines decreased viral clearance velocity, but on the other hand they show a potent anti-inflammatory activity. The latter action is now thought to be very useful in COVID-19 since the immune-system inflammatory response and cytokine storm drive the intermediate and advanced phases of the disease [40]. Pathological findings in COVID-19 pneumonia lungs consisted of pulmonary oedema with proteinaceous exudate and hyaline membrane formation, implying that the use of corticosteroids could be useful in severe patients [39]. Since trials on the use of corticosteroids among patients with respiratory complications from other infections yielded conflicting results, it is necessary to wait for the results of new ad hoc clinical trials to draw some conclusions on the use of systemic glucocorticoids for the treatment of COVID-19 disease (see Table 2—Corticosteroids section). Up to now, studies on the use of corticosteroids in COVID-19 disease were all conducted on very small populations of severe or critical patients and showed faster time in fever resolution, faster improvement in imaging and oxygen saturation and a better survival rate in ARDS patients treated with steroids compared to untreated patients without a delay in viral clearance [41–43]. In a very recent communication, Oxford University disclosed the preliminary results of the RECOVERY trial on the use of dexamethasone in severe and moderate COVID-19 disease. The study was conducted on a large population and showed the efficacy of dexamethasone in reducing deaths especially among ventilated patients and among those receiving oxygen supplementation; no benefit was found among patients not requiring respiratory support [44]. The results of this trial emphasize the importance of steroids as a potent weapon to be used without fear in intermediate and advanced COVID-19 disease phases. More studies are certainly needed to understand which molecule is more suitable, the dosage and the timing that may contribute to achieve the best results.\nTCZ is a humanized monoclonal antibody against IL-6 receptor approved in Europe for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and Takayasu arteritis. It is also effectively used in Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-T-cell cytokine release syndrome. TCZ acts as a cytokine storm blocker, reducing the systemic inflammatory response and macrophage activation. TCZ has been considered as one of the most promising drugs for COVID-19 disease based on the results of Chinese case reports showing a fast improvement in oxygen saturation, imaging and clinical conditions shortly after the molecule administration [45]. Nevertheless, results from Italian studies are more controversial. The partial results of a first Italian study seem to disprove this efficacy rate showing no differences in ICU admission and 7 days mortality rate among treated and untreated groups [46]. A recent press release of AIFA on the results of an Italian multicentre randomized clinical trial on the early administration of TCZ in non-severe COVID-19 disease patients reported that the study was interrupted due to futility since no differences in ICU admission, respiratory failure and mortality were seen among the treated and untreated patients [47]. Conversely, a retrospective observational Italian cohort study suggested that TCZ administration in severe COVID-19 disease resulted in a significantly reduced risk of death and mechanical ventilation [48]. These studies demonstrated that TCZ is probably not useful in preventing severe complications in patients with non-severe COVID-19 disease but may have beneficial effects in subjects with severe COVID-19 disease [47, 48]. Further randomized studies are needed to assess whether the drug could be useful in specific categories of patients. The main studies on the use of TCZ in COVID-19 disease are reported in Table 2—TCZ section.\nSarilumab is another IL-6 receptor antagonist. Several trials evaluating Sarilumab as a potential therapeutic option for COVID-19 treatment are ongoing [49]. Of note, AIFA authorized a clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Sarilumab in severe/advanced disease (see Table 2—Sarilumab section).\nAnakinra is a recombinant antagonist of IL-1 receptor. IL-1 is another important cytokine involved in cytokine storm. Some studies have shown that MERS-CoV virus causes pyroptosis, a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death, with a massive release of IL-1β. Since it seems that the same phenomenon happens in SARS-CoV2 infection, blocking this cytokine could be useful. Some case reports documented the efficacy of this drug in moderate/severe COVID-19 pneumonia [50]. Moreover, a retrospective, non-randomized, small sample size cohort study on a population of severe COVID-19 patients with ARDS, also showed Anakinra’s efficacy in improving respiratory function and in reducing 21-day mortality [51]. Considering the encouraging results of these preliminary studies together with the drug mechanism of action and its remarkable safety profile, anakinra could theoretically be extremely useful in fighting COVID-19 disease. As such, many clinical trials testing this molecule are now ongoing (see Table 2—Anakinra section).\nA group of approved drugs that can inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis and consequently virus entry into target cells was discovered through artificial intelligence. The selected drugs are inhibitors of members of the Numb-Associated-Kinase (NAK) family, including AP2 associated kinase 1 (AAK1) and cyclin G associated kinase (GAK), the inhibition of which has been shown to reduce viral infection in vitro. Baricitinib was identified as a NAK inhibitor, in particular, it showed high affinity for AAK. Also Fedratinib and Ruxolitinib have been found as potential therapeutic weapons belonging to this class. All these three drugs are potent Janus Kinase (JAK)-inhibitors approved for rheumatoid arthritis and myelofibrosis treatment and have powerful anti-inflammatory properties. A dosage study showed that the best option could be Baricitinib, due to the once a day oral administration, the acceptable safety profile and the double mechanism of action targeting JAK inhibition and clathrin-mediated endocytosis (i.e. inflammation and virus entry) at the tolerated dosage. Conversely, Fedratinib and Ruxolitinib are able to inhibit JAK but not the virus endocytosis at tolerated dosage. In addition, Baricitinib could be used in combination with other therapies due to its low plasma protein binding and minimal cytochrome interactions. However, there are also some concerns about Baricitinib use because the simultaneous inhibition of AAK and JAK can reduce Interferon-α levels determining a worsening of immune response with subsequent clinical deterioration [52]. For this reason, other authors suggested Fedratinib as the best drug option among this group because of its selective inhibition of JAK2. Fedratinib decreases IL-17 and IL-22 expression by T helper (Th)17 lymphocytes, suppresses GM-CSF function, but it does not compromise IL-21 mediated B cells function. As a consequence, JAK inhibitors would reduce the cytokine storm via multiple mechanisms [53]. More laboratory and clinical data are needed to clarify the use of these therapeutic options in COVID-19 disease. Table 2—Baricitinb section reports available studies on this topic.\nColchicine is an old drug used in auto-inflammatory disorders and in gout. It counteracts the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome (the leading component in the development of ARDS), thereby reducing the release of IL-1b and an array of other interleukins, including IL-6, that are produced in response to danger signals. Colchicine also inhibits microtubule dynamics by binding to unpolymerized tubulin heterodimers. As such, it seems that colchicine could directly inhibit the virus entry phase in human cells due to interference with clathrin-mediated endocytosis via microtubules inhibition [54]. Indeed, in mice studies colchicine showed efficacy in inhibition of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) replication and suppression of RSV-induced airway inflammation [55]. Moreover, colchicine was thought to be potentially useful for its double action on the heart and pericardium and on lungs due to a decrease in cytokine levels and interstitial cells activation [56]. Many trials in the early use of colchicine for COVID-19 are ongoing all over the world. A brief overview can be seen in Table 2—Colchicine section.\nInterferons are a group of cytokines used for the communication between cells to trigger the defense mechanisms against pathogens. In particular, they have a critical role in the innate immune response, such as the activation of natural killer lymphocytes and macrophages. They also have several antiviral activities, including the induction of viral degradation, the alteration of RNA transcription and protein synthesis, and the promotion of cellular apoptosis. Interferons family is composed of type I, II and III interferons. As a member of type I interferons, Interferon-α is quickly produced during viral infections as part of the innate immune response. Its action leads to the inhibition of viral replication even in Coronaviruses infecting humans and animals. Interferon-β inhibits SARS-CoV virus replication in vitro while γ-Interferon doesn’t. Interferon-α, and to a lesser extent Interferon β-1, were widely used in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics, due to promising results demonstrated by in vitro and in animal studies. SARS-CoV virus produces proteins able to inhibit type I Interferon release causing a delayed production of type I Interferons and a delayed immune response. The rise in serum levels of type I Interferons at the advanced disease stage contributes to the development of cytokine storm with systemic hyperinflammation and accumulation of macrophages and monocytes in lung tissue. It seems that this mechanism also occurs in COVID-19 disease. In particular, SARS-CoV2 virus antagonizes STAT1, a key protein in the Interferon-mediated immune response. The importance of T cell-mediated immune response in respiratory Coronaviruses is well established. Type I Interferon response is crucial in T cell survival and T cells reduce cytokine storm by modulating the innate immune response. A combination of type I Interferon and γ-Interferon or λ-Interferon was shown to synergistically inhibit the virus replication in vitro [57]. Combining interferons gives the opportunity of lowering the dosage of each one to decrease side effects. The timing of Interferon administration is crucial. Type I Interferons effects are protective against virus infections in the first phases; in advanced disease high titers of α and β-Interferons are associated with worst outcomes because they sustain inflammatory response [58]. Up to date, evidence on the use of Interferons in COVID-19 pneumonia is lacking. Chinese national health service recommends α-Interferon 5 million IU twice a day nebulization as a coadjutant treatment option in COVID-19 infection; however, nebulization is a risky procedure due to the aerosol spread of the virus in the environment [59]. Some studies about the administration of Interferons in COVID-19 are reported in Table 2—Interferons section. These studies suggest better results in groups of COVID-19 patients treated with the association of antiviral drugs and Interferons (nebulized or sub-cutaneous administration) or Interferon alone compared to antiviral drugs alone [9, 60, 61]. However, up to date, well-designed studies on large populations are lacking.\nEmapalumab is a human monoclonal antibody against Interferon-γ. It is used in the treatment of refractory primary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) [62]. The cytokine storm developed during advanced hyper-inflammatory COVID-19 disease phase may resemble HLH [40]. Moreover, Interferon-γ levels are associated with an amplification of inflammation and generalized activation of immune response with subsequent hyper-inflammatory state and damage [57]. On this basis, researchers decided to begin clinical trials with Emapalumab as a potential therapeutic option for COVID-19 disease (see Table 2—Emapalumab section).\nIVIGs are human immunoglobulin preparations derived from plasma, indicated for the treatment of diverse diseases such as autoimmune, inflammatory disorders and various immunodeficiencies [63]. During the SARS-CoV epidemic, many observational studies and case reports described IVIGs use in combination with anti-viral drugs for the treatment of critically ill patients. In a clinical review of different treatment protocols for SARS-CoV, the use of IVIGs combined with Interferon was described as ineffective [60]. Since the beginning of SARS-CoV2 infection in Wuhan, clinicians have used IVIGs in patients affected by COVID-19 pneumonia. Some authors, on the basis of the experience acquired with SARS-CoV pneumonia, proposed the use of IVIGs at the dosage of 0.3–0.5 g/kg/day for 5 days in the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. According to the authors’ opinion, this treatment should be started as soon as possible in patients who present these features: leukopenia and lymphopenia (< 1000/ μL), D-dimer elevation above 4 times the upper limit of normal value (ULN) and cytokine increased levels (in particular IL-6). The rationale behind this approach is to try to reduce the cytokine storm developed in the most rapidly evolving patients [1]. Only a few case reports are available on the use of IVIGs in COVID-19 disease patients [64]. Because of the lack of evidence on IVIGs treatment in COVID-19 disease, physicians have proposed a number of trials to assess the efficacy of IVIGs compared to the standard care in severe patients (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04381858) (see Table 3—Intravenous immunoglobulins section).\nEvidence shows that hyperimmune (or convalescent) plasma from patients who have recovered from various viral infections can be useful for the disease treatment without particular warnings. Hyperimmune (or convalescent) plasma has been already used as a last attempt in patients with critical SARS-CoV pneumonia not responding to maximal treatment [65]. Different studies on SARS-CoV pneumonia showed that hyperimmune plasma was effective in reducing hospitalization and mortality. A meta-analysis of 32 studies on SARS-CoV infection and severe influenza showed a statistically significant reduction in the pooled odds of mortality following convalescent plasma therapy compared with placebo or no therapy (OR 0.25; 95% CI 0.14–0.45) [66]. A protocol to encode the use of hyperimmune plasma also in patients affected by MERS-CoV pneumonia was established in 2015. Up to now, there are several case reports of COVID-19 patients treated with hyperimmune plasma that suggested a beneficial effect probably mediated by its antiviral activity. These case reports showed that COVID-19 patients treated with convalescent plasma had large reductions in serum viral loads and most were virus negative 3 days after infusion [66–68]. Recently the results of a Chinese randomized clinical trial have been published. This work, based on a population of 103 severely-ill or with life-threatening COVID-19 disease subjects, did not show statistically significant benefits of convalescent plasma compared to standard therapy in 28 days clinical improvement, mortality and time to discharge. In a subgroup analysis, severely-ill but not critical patients did show a faster clinical improvement when treated with convalescent plasma (p = 0.03). Of note, the study was underpowered, not reaching its target sample size of 200 patients, because enrolment was terminated prematurely due to control of infection spreading in China. It is important to highlight that conventionally convalescent plasma has the maximum efficacy in early viraemic stages of disease; whereas, in this study, it was administered very late after symptoms onset (median of 30 days) [69]. For these reasons, it would be useful to test hyperimmune plasma efficacy in early stages of COVID-19 disease to understand if a timelier administration could be associated with better outcomes. See Table 2—Hyperimmune plasma section.\nThe International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH), based on the current literature, recommends measuring D-Dimer, prothrombin time and platelet count in all patients with COVID-19 disease. This strategy may help clinicians in stratifying patients who may need admission and close monitoring or not [70]. An adjunctive parameter to be considered is the serum fibrinogen, useful for the diagnosis of DIC, a condition highly prevalent in COVID-19 patients who did not survive the infection [7]. Due to the strong association between coagulopathy and mortality in COVID-19, the inhibition of thrombin generation may be beneficial. Moreover, it has been shown that heparin displays an anti-inflammatory action and various immunomodulatory properties. As such, prophylaxis dose LMWH has been proposed in all patients who require hospital admission for COVID-19 disease, in the absence of any contraindications [70]. The effectiveness of this approach is attested by Doctor Ning Tang et al. study; by stratifying patients according to the Sepsis-Induced Coagulopathy (SIC) score, the Authors showed a reduced mortality rate in patients treated with prophylactic LMWH or UFH compared to untreated patients among subjects with a SIC score higher than 4 [3]. Since the publication of this study, the awareness of the importance of anticoagulant therapy in COVID-19 grew exponentially. In his review on the immune changes caused by COVID-19 disease, Lin proposed to treat all severe and critical COVID-19 patients with D-Dimer value fourfold higher than normality with anticoagulant dose of LMWH (100 UI/kg every 12 h) for 3–5 days with close clinical monitoring [1]. A position paper from the Italian Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (SISET) expresses doubts about the administration of anticoagulant dose of LWMH in severe COVID-19 patients since no evidence currently supports this approach. The position paper also advises against the translatability of Chinese COVID-19 population D-dimer cut-off to the Italian population, since D-dimer levels are strongly correlated with age and Italian subjects with COVID-19 disease are much older than the Chinese ones. Further studies need to be conducted to establish a specific D-dimer cut-off for the Italian COVID-19 population. The final recommendations are to administer LMWH, UFH or fondaparinux at prophylaxis doses for venous thromboembolism (VTE) in all hospitalized COVID-19 patients, for the entire duration of the hospital stay. The use of intermediate-dose LMWH (i.e. Enoxaparin 4000 IU subcutaneously every 12 h) can be considered on an individual basis in patients with multiple risk factors for VTE [71]. An Italian group of ICU physicians highlighted the fact that since severe/critical COVID-19 disease is associated with an increased rate of DIC and VTE, augmented LMWH dosing could be useful in reducing the coagulopathy risk in mechanically ventilated patients. A study conducted in a northern Italy ICU department showed no increased mortality and no major bleeding after anticoagulant therapy augmentation (anticoagulant dosage of LMWH and UFH) indicating the need for further studies comparing the different doses of heparin and outcomes with a greater interest in mortality and adverse events [72]. The main studies on this topic can be found in Table 3—Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and unfractioned heparin (UFH) section [3, 72, 73].\nAzithromycin is an antibiotic belonging to the macrolide class. It inhibits bacterial synthesis but also shows in vitro activity against viruses such as Influenza A H1N1 (interference with internalization process) and Zika (upregulation of virus-induced Interferons type I and III). Moreover, azithromycin anti-inflammatory effect on lung tissue, even during viral infections, is well known. It acts suppressing T-helper 1 and 2 lymphocyte-related cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNFα) and INF inducible protein 10 (IP-10)/macrophage derived chemokine (MDC) in monocytic cell line. Its use has been associated with decreased major respiratory complications during viral respiratory infections in clinical studies [74].\nDoxycycline is an antibiotic belonging to the tetracycline class. It interferes with bacterial protein synthesis and demonstrated in vitro activity against viral infections (i.e. Influenza and Dengue). Moreover, doxycycline presents documented anti-inflammatory effects by acting on Nf-Kb pathway and by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1b, IL-6 and TNFα). An experimental study on mice showed that the use of doxycycline during severe influenza pneumonia was associated with a better outcome with less inflammatory lung lesions and ARDS prevention [75]. Another study suggested that the administration of doxycycline in patients with Dengue haemorrhagic fever reduced cytokines (IL-6 and TNFα) blood levels, mortality and discharge time [76]. Recent studies suggested that coronaviruses induce the proliferation of mast cells within the respiratory submucosa and that chemically-modified tetracyclines can induce apoptosis of mast cells and activation of protein-kinase C, thus decreasing levels of circulating inflammatory mediators [77]. For these reasons, some studies are testing doxycycline efficacy in COVID-19 pneumonia.\nACE2 is a monocarboxypeptidase that hydrolyses multiple peptides, including angiotensin; in particular, the enzyme forms angiotensin-(1–7) by cleaving angiotensin II. The former has a vasodilator, anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effect, while the latter determines vasoconstriction and enhances inflammation. Since ARB and ACE inhibitors determine an increase in ACE2 expression, at the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic, it was thought that they could be harmful by facilitating SARS-CoV2 attachment and entry. However, it has been subsequently demonstrated that SARS-CoV2, once attached to ACE2, determines a down-regulation in its expression in the lungs and as a consequence a decrease in angiotensin-(1–7) and an increase in angiotensin II with possible acute lung injury and enhanced global inflammation. As such, it is now thought that these two drug classes may be beneficial in controlling lung damage and inflammation. ARB and ACE-inhibitors may act as a double-edged sword: on the one hand, these two drugs could enhance infectivity by inducing ACE2 over-expression; on the other hand, the subjects treated with ARB or ACE-inhibitors, once infected, exhibit a more balanced equilibrium between angiotensin II and angiotensin-(1–7) which may prevent systemic and lung inflammation and damage [78]. Some recent studies suggested that patients chronically treated with ARB and ACEi not only are not at increased risk of SARS-CoV2 infection or worse COVID-19 outcomes but even may show a less severe disease course. Another possible therapeutic approach targeting this pathway consists in soluble recombinant ACE2 intravenous infusion; this strategy determines a reduction in viral load since the virus could bind the “false” receptor [79].\nTMPRSS2 is a serine protease located on the epithelial cell surface of specific tissues including the respiratory tract. This protease cleaves SARS-CoV2 spike protein and activates the virus internalization. Researchers have tried to find ways to reduce TMPRSS2 expression or to block its activity as a potential therapeutic option for COVID-19 disease. Two classes of drugs have been thought to be used so far: anti-androgens or oestrogens to reduce the TMPRSS2 expression, and Camostat Mesilate, a potent serine-protease inhibitor. In vitro studies have shown a potent inhibitory effect of Camostat Mesilate on SARS-CoV2 entry ability [80]. Five clinical studies to test Camostat Mesilate efficacy in COVID-19 disease are now ongoing.\nIn this review, we described the main drugs tested until now or with a putative therapeutic role against SARS-CoV2 infection; in particular, we detailed the possible mechanisms of action of the selected molecules in COVID-19 disease and, when available, we described the results of the main clinical studies in COVID-19 patients. An important issue that is worth to highlight is the emergency setting in which these studies have been conducted so far. As such, the vast majority of the studies that have been analysed suffer from several methodological limitations, notably including a lack of randomized, double-blind design, a lack of control populations, small or underpowered sample size, and even a lack of peer review evaluations before publication. Moreover, in many cases, the compared groups of patients are heterogeneous in clinical features, disease severity and concurrent pharmacological treatment. Finally, the reported outcomes include a plethora of virologic, biochemical, radiological and clinical aspects that have poor consistency across studies and are limited in time of follow-up. Taking all these considerations in mind, it is difficult to draw some valid conclusions on drugs efficacy in COVID-19 disease treatment.\nFor what concerns antiviral drugs, the available pathophysiological knowledge on SARS-CoV2 infection and the clinical studies performed so far suggest that the timing of administration of this class of molecules is important. Indeed, they can be effective if dispensed in the first viraemic stage of infection, early after symptoms onset. Among these <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightgreen; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">drugs<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">usages</span>\n</mark> , the most effective seems to be <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightorange; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">Remdesivir<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">chemical</span>\n</mark> , even if further large, randomized, double-blind <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightpink; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">studies<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">trials</span>\n</mark> are eagerly awaited.\nAmong immunomodulatory drugs, CQ and HCQ are two controversial molecules. From early studies conducted in France it seems they can be effective if administered very early, at disease presentation. However, their use in hospitalized critical/severe COVID-19 patients do not seem to be associated with improved outcomes and there are concerns about their cardiotoxicity. Importance must be attributed to immunomodulatory drugs such as corticosteroids (in particular dexamethasone) and biological molecules (Tocilizumab, Anakinra and others) which seem to be valid and useful therapeutic options in the inflammatory phase of the disease. However, further studies are necessary to better understand if they can also be active in the early phases of the disease.\nAmong other classes of drugs, LMWH and UFH may also have a major therapeutic role when facing COVID-19-related coagulopathy, but future studies have to establish the correct dosing, timing and length of treatment.\nIn conclusion, COVID-19 is a novel, life-threatening disease, that does not have a cure able to arrest its progression yet. Up to now, treatment choices have been inferred from the experience with other coronaviruses or viral infection outbreaks. New treatment strategies will hopefully be available in the near future in parallel with the increased knowledge of SARS-CoV2 virus and COVID-19 pathogenesis. In the meantime, further well-designed clinical trials on homogeneous populations are urgently needed to establish a standard of care in COVID-19 disease.</br></br>UNKNOWN URL AND TITLE</br></br>The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in more than 6.6 million confirmed cases worldwide. Previous studies showed that both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV belong to the subfamily Coronavirinae of the Nidovirales coronaviridae, and are classified as SARS-like species, but belong to different clusters. To further explore the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, we compared different aspects of the virus with those of SARS-CoV; the clinical manifestations and treatment methods are also summarized.\nCoronaviruses belong to the subfamily Coronavirinae in the family Coronaviridae of the order Nidovirales and can cause respiratory, digestive, and nervous system diseases in humans and many other animals. Coronavirus particles are spherical with a diameter of approximately 80 to 160 mm. The envelope surface is covered with spike (S) protein, and the membrane (M) proteins and envelope (E) proteins are located among the S proteins. The genomic RNA and phosphorylated nucleocapsid (N) protein form a spiral nucleocapsid, which is located within the envelope [1, 2]. The coronavirus genome is comprised of a single-stranded positive-strand RNA ranging from 26 Kb to 32 Kb in length, constituting the longest known genome among RNA viruses [3]. This genome has a 5′ cap structure, a 3′ polyadenylate tail structure, and six open reading frames (ORFs), of which the first (ORF1) near the 5′ terminus encodes 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1–16) involved in viral replication and transcription; other ORFs encode the four major structural proteins (S, M, N, and P) and eight accessory proteins (3a, 3b, p6, 7a, 7b, 8b, 9b, and ORF14), playing an important role in the assembly of viral particles.\nAccording to genetic and antigenic characteristics, coronaviruses can be divided into four genera: α, β, γ, and δ. Among them, α and β coronaviruses only infect mammals, while γ and δ mainly infect birds, although some can also infect mammals [4, 5]. Except for SARS-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), most coronaviruses do not cause severe diseases in humans. It has been confirmed that the recent outbreak and epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was caused by a new coronavirus that has been named SARS-CoV-2. Different from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in genetics and epidemiology, SARS-CoV-2 is a novel β-coronavirus [6, 7]. As of now, three types of highly pathogenic coronaviruses have been confirmed, namely SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 [8].\nIn our review, we explore the differences in the origin and evolution, amino acid composition and protein structure, epidemiological and pathological characteristics between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. In addition, the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 has been summarized. Based on our expertise, comorbidity of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in COVID-19 patients and SARS-CoV-2-induced myocardial injury and venous thromboembolism (VTE) are fully discussed, and medicines with recent clinical trial outcomes are also introduced.\nAccording to the principle of international commission on virus classification, the coronavirus identification mainly depends on the similarity of the amino acid sequences of the seven domains encoded by ORF1ab, including ADRP, nsp5, and nsp12–16. Due to the extremely similar (more than 90%) amino acid sequences in the seven domains, both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV belong to the subfamily Coronavirinae in the family Coronaviridae of the order Nidovirales and are classified as SARS-like species, although they are classified into different clusters. The former belongs to the bat-like coronavirus cluster and the latter to the SARS cluster. Phylogenetic analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 has a longer branch length compared to its closest relatives, including bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21; furthermore, it is genetically different from SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 has only 79.5 and 40% homology with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, indicating a large genetic distance. At the same time, the S-protein homology between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 is also relatively low at 76.5% [9–12].\nWhile SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to SARS-CoV in amino acid composition and protein structure, with both having an Orf1ab encoding 16 predicted Nsps as well as the 4 typical coronavirus structural proteins, they also show some differences, mainly in the S, ORF8, ORF3b, and ORF10 proteins, with limited detectable homology between them.\nLike SARS-CoV, the entry of SARS-CoV-2 is mediated by the recognition of the receptor binding domain (RBD) in the S protein and the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the surface of the host cell, and the activation of S protein is related to TMPRSS2, whose inhibitors can prevent virus invasion [13]. Most of the SARS-CoV-induced polyclonal antibodies can prevent the S-mediated entry of the virus, which further illustrates the similarity between these two coronaviruses. However, according to previous researches, the outer subdomain of the receptor-binding domain in the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 has only 40% amino acid homology with other SARS-associated coronaviruses [3]. A recent research found that Furin protease cleavage site exists at the boundary between the S1 subunit and S2 subunit in the S protein of SARS-CoV-2, and it is processed during the biosynthesis [14]. This is similar to several highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses [15] and pathogenic Newcastle disease virus [16], but distinguishes SARS-CoV-2 from SARS-CoV. The existence of the cleavage site of the Furin protease enhances the tissue and cell tropism and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, and alters its pathogenicity. Wrapp et al. [17] obtained the trimeric structure of the S protein by 3D reconstruction technology based on the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2, and found that it is structurally different from that of SARS-CoV. In addition, the affinity of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 increased by 10–20 times compared with that of SARS-CoV. Blocking the process of viral entry is an important way to prevent and control viral infections; identifying and understanding the protein molecules on the surface of the new coronavirus, related receptors of target cell, as well as their interaction mechanisms can provide a basis for effectively preventing viruses from invading host cells. RBD is recognized primarily via polar residues by the extracellular peptidase domain of ACE2. Yan et al. [18] analyzed the electron microscope structure of the complex of S protein and ACE2, and found that in the procedure of the virus-target cell binding, the loop region on RBD crossed the α1 helix of ACE2, and the loop regions of β3, β4 and α2 helix are also involved in the combination of RBD and ACE2. Superimposing of the structures of SARS-COV-RBD and SARS-COV-2-RBD suggests a very high degree of similarity between the two, but there are still differences. The R426, Y484, T487, V404, and L472 residues in SARS-COV-RBD were replaced by N439, Q498, N501, K417, and F486 in the SARS-COV-2-RBD respectively. The replacement of L472 by F486 will enhance the van der Waals effect, and that of R426 by N439 will eliminate the salt bridge effect of D329 in ACE2, which, however, would be strengthened when V404 is replaced by K417. The existence of these mutations may be a significant reason SARS-COV-specific RBD antibody drugs fail to work on SARS-COV-2.\nThe motif VLVVL (amino acids 75–79) was reported in SARS-CoV ORF8b, which can trigger the intracellular stress pathway and activate the NLRP3 endosome, while no functional domains containing this motif has been found in SARS-CoV-2. ORF8 is related to the evolution of SARS-associated coronaviruses, and plays a significant role in virus replication, transmission, and adaptation to its hosts. In SARS-CoV-2, ORF8 consists of 121 amino acids, while it exists as ORF8a (39 amino acids) and ORF8b (84 amino acids) in SARS-CoV. The ORF3b protein contains 154 amino acids in SARS-CoV, but only 67 amino acids in SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the ORF3b protein of SARS-CoV-2 contains four new helical structures, and shows no homology to that of SARS-CoV. Although ORF3b protein is not necessary for virus replication, it may be related to its pathogenicity and its importance in SARS-CoV-2 requires further study [19].\nRecently, a study carried out by multiple teams in the United States, France, and the UK cloned, tagged and expressed 26 of the 29 SARS-CoV-2 proteins in human cells, and suggested that ORF10 of SARS-CoV-2 shows limited homology with that of SARS-CoV. The study found that ORF10 of SARS-CoV-2 is small in size (38 amino acids), but contains an alpha helical region, which can be linked to a Cullin 2 (CUL2) RING E3 ligase complex, especially the CUL2ZYG11B complex, and hijack it for ubiquitination and restriction factor degradation. Alternatively, ZYG11B may bind to the N-terminal glycine in Orf10 to target it for degradation, which is closely related to virus replication [20].\nCurrently, it is believed that the SARS-CoV-2 genome is more stable than SARS-CoV, but it is still necessary to strengthen the monitoring of viral genome mutations as the epidemic progresses. Some large-scale viral genome studies suggest that 149 mutation sites have appeared in SARS-CoV-2. Due to the sequence difference in site 28,144 in the viral RNA genome, SARS-CoV-2 is divided into two subtypes: L and S. The L type spreads more widely, and has more mutations and a stronger ability to spread. Compared with other coronavirus, the gene sequence of S protein in SARS-CoV-2 changes greatly, suggesting that this segment may show a higher mutation rate [21]. Su et al. used a second-generation sequencing platform to analyze the nasal swab samples of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and found that the 3′-end of the SARS-CoV-2 genome has a fragment with 382 nt missing, resulting in the destruction of the function of the ORF8 region, which may relate to how SARS-CoV-2 adapts to human survival [22]. Distinctions in the structure between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are shown in Fig. 1.\n\nThe SARS epidemic in 2003 first occurred in Guangdong Province. Sources of SARS-CoV infection include infected animals and humans. At present, it is generally believed that the virus originates from bats, and civet is a possible intermediate host, and humans are the final hosts [23].\nAt the end of 2019, the first outbreak of pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 occurred in Wuhan, Hubei [24]. Besides infected animals and COVID-19 patients, asymptomatic infectors are the most important source of infection for SARS-CoV-2 [25]. Studies have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 is of bat origin [12, 26], with pangolin or civet as one of the possible intermediate hosts, and humans are the ultimate hosts [27]. It is worth noting that a recent study isolated one coronavirus from a Malayan pangolin showing 100, 98.6, 97.8, and 90.7% amino acid identity with SARS-CoV-2 in the E, M, N and S genes, respectively, and the receptor-binding domain within the S protein of the Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of SARS-CoV-2, with only one noncritical amino acid difference. This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 might have originated from the recombination of a Pangolin-CoV-like virus with a Bat-CoV-RaTG13-like virus [28]. However, more research is required to confirm this.\nSARS-CoV is transmitted through close-up droplets and contact, while SARS-CoV-2 has a wider range of transmission routes. In addition to short-distance droplet transmission and contact transmission, SARS-CoV-2 can also be transmitted through aerosols in the enclosed space and urine, and mother-to-child transmission may also exist [29–31]. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention isolated the SARS-CoV-2 strain from a feces sample of a confirmed patient in Heilongjiang Province, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 can survive in the stool; it has been demonstrated that after intragastric administration of SARS-CoV-2, transgenic mice that express human ACE2 can get the infection and show related pathological changes [32]. This suggests that fecal-oral transmission may also be one of its transmission modes [29, 33].\nThe population is generally susceptible to SARS-CoV, mostly young adults; and people are also generally susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. Epidemiological analysis shows that 77.8% of patients with COVID-19 are between 30 and 69 years of age, with the highest proportion in the 50 to 60 years age group, while the infection rate of children is relatively low [8, 34].\nIt is generally believed that SARS-CoV-2 has a stronger propagation capability than SARS-CoV. A previous study showeed basic reproduction number (R0) was 2.9 [35, 36]. Based on the epidemiological data of 425 patients, another study showed the basic reproduction number R0 of this new coronary pneumonia to be 2.20 [37, 38]. Moreover, there is a study that predicts the R0 value of SARS-CoV-2 to be 3.28 [39]. Yang et al. [40] predicted the R0 to be 3.77—higher than SARS-CoV—but because of the uncertainty, the accuracy of the estimate is limited. The latest research shows that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 is about 2.68, which is roughly similar to the R0 reported by World Health Organization (WHO) and the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention [41, 42]. SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and up to June 17, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 infection had occurred in as many as 216 countries and the cumulative number of COVID-19 patients globally had reached 8,061,550, according to the data from WHO.\nSARS-CoV-2 spreads easily but it is less lethal. The mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2 was lower than that of SARS-CoV. Studies have shown that approximately 23 to 32% of patients with SARS will develop severe disease and are prone to death [43]. A report by WHO shows that 774 of 8098 SARS patients died, with a case fatality rate of 9.6%. In elderly patients, case fatality rate was up to 50% [36]. SARS-CoV-2 has a wider range of transmission than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, and infects a larger number of patients, but the ratio of critically ill COVID-19 patients is relatively lower. Epidemiological characteristics of more than 70,000 cases described that 80.9% COVID-19 patients presented mild/moderate illness. Meanwhile, the crude death rate of COVID-19 was 2.3% and the death rate was 0.015/10 person-days [34], much lower than the mortality rates of SARS [44]. Severe illness and death are more common in older patients with underlying conditions. Meanwhile, SARS-CoV-2 not only affects the lungs, but also the heart and kidneys, causing multiple organ failure. Consequently, therapy for severe COVID patients is more difficult than that for SARS.\nDuring the widespread epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 in the world, analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genomic system evolution network revealed three variants, which the researchers tentatively named A, B, and C. Among them, A is an ancestor type; B is derived from A through two mutations of the synonymous mutation T8782C and the non-synonymous mutation C28144T, which is derived from A. The difference between type C and its parent type B is the non-synonymous mutation G26144T, and this mutation converts glycine to valine. Notably, the different types have different geographical distributions in the world. A and C mainly exist in Europe and the United States, while B mainly exists in East Asia, suggesting that Wuhan, the first outbreak spot of type B SARS-CoV-2 may not be the origin of SARS-CoV-2. This provides a new idea for the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 [45].\nAutopsy results in SARS patients suggest that SARS-CoV infection causes severe pulmonary edema, pulmonary congestion, hilar lymphadenopathy, and spleen shrinkage in general [46, 47]. Histological features of patients with SARS include bronchial epithelial exfoliation, loss of cilia and squamous metaplasia, diffuse alveolar damage, formation of hyaline membranes, and severe fibrosis of the lung tissue. SARS-CoV can be detected in lymphocytes, monocytes, lymphoid tissues, and respiratory tract as well as in intestinal mucosa, renal tubular epithelial cells, and neurons [48, 49].\nCertain pathological characteristics of COVID-19 patients have been identified. Pulmonary pathological results attained by Tian et al. [50] suggested that the early pathological changes induced by SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia include pathological interstitial pneumonia and prominent pulmonary edema, with protein exudation and minor inflammatory cell infiltration. Xu et al. [51] performed a case dissection on a patient and the results showed that bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates and hyaline membrane formation corresponded to acute respiratory distress symptoms (ARDS); moreover, the overall pathological characteristics of the lung were similar in SARS and MERS. Inflammatory infiltration of lymphocyte-dominated mononuclear cells and other viral cytopathic-like changes were seen in the lung, but no intranuclear or intracytoplasmic viral inclusions were found. Minor inflammatory infiltration of mononuclear cells was present in the myocardial interstitium and the existence of viral myocarditis could not be ruled out, but no obvious damage to the myocardium was found. Based on the pathology report of one particular patient, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the cardiovascular system cannot be determined; hence, additional sample research and analysis are necessary. Another autopsy of a COVID-19 patient in China found that mucus exudation was more obvious than that in SARS patients and lung damage involving diffuse alveolar damage and pulmonary hyaline membrane formation was serious. Histopathologic changes seen on postmortem transthoracic needle biopsies from a COVID-19 patient with hypertension and diabetes showed diffuse alveolar damage. Virus was more highly detected in alveolar epithelial cells, while viral protein expression was low in blood vessels or in the interstitial areas [52]. A recent pathological study of African American patients found that in addition to diffuse alveolar injury, inflammatory cell infiltration, and hyaline membrane formation, COVID-19 patients also have thrombi in peripheral small vessels with obvious bleeding in the lungs, while no obvious thrombus was found in other organs, including kidney, spleen, pancreas, and liver. At the same time, it was reported that there are a large number of CD61+ megakaryocytes in the alveolar capillaries, and a large number of platelets are actively produced. The large aggregation of platelets and fibrin deposition may jointly promote the production of thrombi within peripheral small vessels in lungs [53]. However, evidence of damage to other organs and/or systems requires more substantial autopsy results.\nThe differences between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are shown in Table 1.\n\nWhen SARS-CoV-2 invades the human body, the RBD on the S1 subunit of the S protein binds to ACE2 expressed on the host cell surface. Subsequently the conformation of the S protein undergoes a significant structural rearrangement, resulting in shedding of the S1 subunit and transition of the S2 subunit to a highly stable post-fusion conformation, which in turn mediates the fusion of the virus with the host cell membrane and cell entry [2]. After entering the cell, SARS-CoV-2 multiplies and eventually lyses the host cell, causing extensive alveolar damage and ARDS in infected patients.\nIn addition to mediating the entry of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 into host cells, ACE2 is also an important mediator of inflammation in the human body. It is mainly expressed in the small intestine, testis, adipose tissue, kidney, heart and thyroid, and lung tissue in the human body, and is also expressed in relatively low amounts in the colon, liver, bladder and adrenal glands, blood, spleen, bone marrow, brain, blood vessels, and muscles [55]. ACE2 is an enzyme that converts angiotensin (Ang) I to Ang 1–9, Ang II to Ang 1–7, and the latter can interact with MAS receptors, thereby inhibiting the harmful vasodilation and pro-fibrosis mediated by the AT1 receptor and mediating a variety of beneficial negative feedback regulation [56]. A lack of ACE2 will increase the levels of the two Ang peptides, thereby activating the Ang AT 1 and AT 2 receptors expressed on the surface of alveolar epithelium, vascular endothelium, intestinal epithelium, and kidney cells. During the fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane and cell entry, ACE2 is internalized accordingly due to its binding to the virus, thereby down regulating ACE2 on the cell surface [56]. The dysregulation of the ACE2-Ang II-AT1 receptor axis and the ACE2-Ang1–7-Mas receptor axis is an important cause of endothelial cell damage, inflammation, and thrombosis [55].\nA large number of studies have shown that the progression of severe COVID-19 patients is closely related to the massive production and activation of cytokines and inflammatory mediators. The inflammatory response is strong during SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the uncontrolled inflammation of the lungs caused by it may be the main cause of death in some cases. Intensive care unit (ICU) patients have higher levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-1Ra, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, basic FGF, GCSF, GM-CSF, IFN-γ, CXCL10, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, PDGF, TNF-α, and VEGF in the plasma than healthy controls, and higher levels of IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, GCSF, CXCL10, CCL2, CCL3, and TNF than non-ICU patients [57]. In addition, neutrophils, elevated D-dimers, and blood urea nitrogen were found in deceased patients infected with COVID-19, suggesting that death may be the result of cytokine storms, inflammatory responses, and acute kidney injury [58]. Nlrp3γ inflammasome, as a powerful pro-inflammatory system in the body, is also an important cause of cytokine storm. Nlrp3γ is expressed in many cells, including immune, endothelial, hematopoietic, lung epithelial, kidney, and heart cells. High levels of Ang II may over-activate Nlrp3γ in these cells and trigger an immune response through intracellular caspase-1, thereby releasing a large number of inflammatory factors, such as IL-1β and IL-18, and creating gasdermin D pore channels in cell membranes to mediate the release of several biologically active danger-associated molecular pattern molecules, finally mediating cell apoptosis and lysis [56].\nThe complement system is also involved in immune injury in COVID-19 patients. In the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of COVID-19 patients, the genes related to complement activation are enriched, and the serum complement levels in patients with severe COVID-19 are higher than those in mild cases and healthy controls, indicating that complement-mediated immune injury may be one of the causes of cell damage and aggravation of the disease in patients with COVID-19 [59, 60]. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL), a pattern recognition protein present in serum can be combined with MBL-associated serine protease 2 (MASP-2) to initiate the complement-activated lectin pathway by binding to sugar molecules on the surface of pathogens. The SARS-CoV-2 N protein can interact with MASP-2, inducing MASP-2 to automatically activate and cleave complement protein C4 [59]. Massive deposition of MBL, MASP-2, and C3 and C4 lysates (C4a, C4d) in lung tissue and the membrane attack complex formed with C5b-9 can cause damage and lysis of alveolar cells.\nLymphopenia, a common feature in patients with COVID-19, was identified in a patient by flow cytometry while lymphocytes were found to be over-activated. This potentially constitutes a key factor related to disease severity and mortality. The number of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood of patients was greatly reduced, while a higher number of double positive HLA-DR and CD38 suggested the activation of T cells. In addition, the number of CCR4+ CCR6+ Th17 cells with a high pro-inflammatory effect was increased and CD8+ T cells had a high concentration of cytotoxic granules including perforin and granulysin. Over-activation of T cells characterized by an increase in Th17 and high cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells could partially explain the severe immune damage in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Viral infection rarely caused a Th17 response, but over-activation of Th17/CD8 was detected in patients with COVID-19 requiring medical attention.\nHowever, the latest research indicates that patients with severe COVID-19 also have impaired cytotoxic lymphocyte killing function [61]. All subtypes of lymphocytes in patients with COVID-19 are reduced, including T cells, B cells, and NK cells. In quantitative analysis of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells at different stages of maturity [61], it was found that compared with healthy subjects, the frequency of TEMRA (CD45RA+ CCR7−) and senescent CD8+ T cells (CD57 +) in COVID-19 patients was significantly higher. However, Tem (CD45RA7−CCR77−) and HLA-DR+ CD8+ T cells did not show related changes compared with healthy subjects, exhibiting a skewing of CD8+ T cells towards a terminally differentiated/senescent phenotype; similar findings were also observed for CD4+ T cells. Research on NK cells showed that, in addition to a reduced number of the cells in patients with COVID-19, their ability to produce IFN-α, perforin, and granzymes was also reduced, leading to an impaired virus clearance function. IL-6 may play a major role in the process of the dysfunction of NK cell [61, 62]. In patients with severe COVID-19, the decrease in NK cells and their dysfunction are significantly inversely proportional to the level of IL-6 in the serum, while anti-IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody tocilizumab treatment is able to reverse this process, suggesting that high levels of IL-6 exposure can down-regulate the expression of perforin and granzyme in NK cell. In conclusion, the senescence of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as well as the impaired function of NK cells can lead to the evasion of SARS-CoV-2 from the immune attack and clearance in patients with severe COVID-19.\nSARS-CoV-2 infection causes systemic and respiratory symptoms such as fever, muscle soreness, cough, and dyspnea. Guan et al. [30] collected data of 1099 confirmed COVID-19 patients from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in China and demonstrated that cough (67.8%) is the most common symptom among patients, while only 43.8% of patients were diagnosed with fever. ARDS, respiratory failure, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, as well as septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulation dysfunction were found to manifest in severe cases. Meanwhile, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and other gastrointestinal symptoms as well as chest pain, heart palpitations, and other cardiovascular symptoms can also be the first symptoms in patients with COVID-19. Laboratory tests show normal or decreased peripheral blood leukocytes, reduced lymphocyte counts, and abnormalities in liver enzymes, myocardial enzymes, and C-reactive protein. In severe cases, increases in D-dimer and inflammatory factors are detected. Computerized tomography showed that ground-glass opacity is the most common radiologic characteristic and “paving stone sign” may appear in the advanced stage [63, 64]. At present, the diagnosis is primarily based on the pathogenic examination of nucleic acid detection. However, nucleic acid detection is subject to factors such as material selection, which may cause a certain false negative rate. Therefore, patients presenting epidemiological characteristics, clinical manifestations, and typical imaging characteristics with negative nucleic acid detection are classified as clinically confirmed cases that must be treated in isolation in the clinic.\nMany studies report that patients with COVID-19 often have comorbidities—commonly CVD. Based on the published data in China, the prevalence of CVD in COVID-19 patients varied from 1% [65] to 39% [66]. CDC COVID-19 Response Team analyzed the data from 50 U.S. states, four U.S. territories, and affiliated islands and showed that 9.0% of patients were suffering from CVD [67]. Buckner et al. [68], however, demonstrated that the ratio reached to 38% in Washington State. Mehra et al. [69] enrolled 8910 patients with COVID-19 from 169 hospitals in Asia, Europe, and North America and showed that 10.2% of the patients had coronary artery disease. Meta-analysis confirmed considerable prevalence of CVD among COVID-19 patients. Li et al. [70] reported that the prevalence of cardia-cerebrovascular diseases in COVID-19 patients was 16.4% and another study [71] showed 11.9% of patients with COVID-19 also had CVD. Various proportions of COVID-19 patients with CVD have been singled out due to selection bias and different data samples. It is also worth noting that various definitions of CVD were used in the different studies. For example, some studies recognized coronary heart disease and heart failure as CVD, while some also included cerebrovascular disease and hypertension. Therefore, these results should be cautiously interpreted [72]. Broader data analysis with uniform definition for CVD remains necessary to determine the proportion of COVID-19 patients with CVD.\nCVD is regarded as a risk factor of COVID-19 progression and is associated with higher risk of mortality of patients with COVID-19. A previous cross-sectional study reported that COVID-19 patients with CVD and hypertension were more likely to be transferred to the ICU [58]. Furthermore, the co-incidence of COVID-19 with coronary heart disease (5.8% vs. 1.8%) was higher in patients with severe COVID-19 than in non-severe patients [30]. Studies [73, 74] found that CVD was associated with disease severity(OR = 3.14; 95% CI 2.32–4.24; OR = 2.74; 95% CI 1.50–5.00) and also the higher prevalence of CVD in critical/mortal COVID-19 patients compared to the non-critical group was shown(OR = 4.78, 95% CI = 2.71–8.42) in another latest study [75]. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention announced that the crude mortality of COVID-19 was approximately 0.9%, while in patients with CVD, it rose to 10.5%. Zhang et al. [74] enrolled 541 patients with COVID-19 and showed the mortality of patients with CVD reached to 22.2%. Presence of CVD was associated with higher mortality (OR = 4.85, 95% CI 3.07–7.70). These studies suggest that more intensive medical care should be provided to patients with COVID-19 having CVD to prevent disease progression and poor prognosis [76].\nMyocardial injury is one of the most common complications in patients with COVID-19, especially those in severe condition, with rates reported variously and often indicating a poor prognosis. The prevalence of patients with myocardial injury complication varies from 7.2% [58] to 27.8% [77]. In our upcoming meta-analysis, 7 studies were included and the analysis indicated that the pooled prevalence of myocardial injury complication in COVID-19 patients is 17.0%. In addition, myocardial injury is more commonly seen in severe cases. Huang et al. [57] and Wang et al. [58] demonstrated that the incidence of myocardial injury was 30.7 and 22.2%, respectively. Li et al. [78] showed that the ratio was 34.9% in severe patients. Moreover, it has been proved that myocardial injury is associated with higher risk of in-hospital mortality. The mortality was 51.2% in myocardial injury group, while that in patients without myocardial injury was 4.5% (P < 0.001) [79]. Similar results were also demonstrated in other studies [80–82]. Although the specific mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 causes myocardial injury remain unclear, they may be related to the following:\ni.Direct damage Due to the wide expression of ACE2 receptors in cardiomyocytes, a large number of SARS-CoV-2 may directly invade cardiomyocytes through binding to the receptor, which may cause the cardiac damage. Besides, replication and reproduction of SARS-CoV-2 rely on substrates in cardiomyocytes, which may lead to abnormal metabolism of cardiomyocytes and consequent damage.ii.Down-regulation of ACE2 Levels of Ang II, an inflammatory factor regulatory protein, are elevated by SARS-CoV-2 infection, leading to the production of reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress injury of myocardial cells [83, 84]. After Ang II recognizes the AT 1 receptor, several kinases, including extracellular regulated protein kinases 1/2, c-Jun N-terminal kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription, calcium kinase II and protein kinase C, are also activated. In addition, the down-regulation of ACE2 caused by SARS-CoV-2 activates the ADAM-17/TACE pathway, which leads to increased release of TNF-α and subsequent myocardial inflammatory damage [85, 86]. However, changes in the content of Ang II and ACE2, the initiating factors, and the specific molecular mechanisms that damage the body, require further study.iii.Immune damage and cytokine storm Similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 induces the release of a large number of cytokines, causing a cytokine storm that damages myocardial cells [87]. TNF-α, produced by activated macrophages, may be a main chemokine in patients with COVID-19, causing the release of a series of pro-inflammatory factors that also plays an essential role in myocardial damage [88]. The specific molecular mechanisms involving immune damage and cytokine storms with myocardial damage must be studied further.iv.Oxygen supply-demand imbalance. Pulmonary pathology suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection is mainly due to exudative changes, leading to hypoxemia or respiratory failure. In addition, patients with COVID-19 have systemic symptoms such as fever, leading to increased oxygen demand, which further exacerbates the imbalance between oxygen supply and demand. Mitochondrial damage and oxidative stress induced by the imbalance between oxygen supply and demand are important pathophysiological mechanisms of cardiac damage caused by viral infection [89, 90]. It is speculated that myocardial damage induced by SARS-CoV-2 may also be related to oxidative stress. Mitochondrial structure and function are dysfunctional under hypoxic conditions, the production of antioxidant substances is reduced, and the level of reactive oxygen species is increased, which induces myocardial damage. In addition, endoplasmic reticulum stress induced by hypoxia promotes increase of pro-apoptotic factors and expression of apoptosis gene through activation of PERK-ATF4-CHOP (protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase-transcription activator 4-C/EBP homologous protein) pathway, thereby inducing cardiomyocyte apoptosis and myocardial injury [91]. The different mechanisms of myocardial injury induced by SARS-CoV-2 are shown in Fig. 2.\nSARS-CoV-2-induced hypercoagulability and VTE have received great attention recently [92, 93]. Middeldorp et al. [94] showed that 19.6% pf patients with COVID-19 show VTE complication. Llitjos et al. [95], Klok et al. [96], and Cui SP et al. [97] demonstrated that the prevalence of VTE was up to 69.2, 27, and 24.7%, respectively, in ICU-COVID-19 patients. It has been shown that the level of D-dimer is higher in COVID-19 patients [98]. Compared with the non-severe patients of COVID-19, a higher proportion of elevated D-dimer was observed among severe cases [99, 100] and higher level of D-dimer is one of the risk factors for disease progression [101–103]. Besides, higher concentrations of D-dimer (aHR = 1.10 [1.01–1.19] per decile increase) were independently associated with in-hospital mortality [104]. A retrospective cohort study also demonstrated that D-dimer > 1 μg/mL on admission was associated with higher risk of death (OR = 18.4, 95% CI: 2.6–128.6, p = 0.003) [105]. SARS-CoV-2 induces endothelial injury and cytokine storm may explain the appearance of VTE and elevated D-dimer in COVID-19 patients [106, 107] while the exact molecular mechanisms still need to be elucidated. In clinics, VTE and dynamic changes in D-dimer levels should be considered to prevent the clinical deterioration of patients with COVID-19.\nTCM shows encouraging results in improving symptoms and decreasing the deterioration, mortality, and recurrence rates of COVID-19. In China, 91.5% of patients with COVID-19 have used TCM and efficiency exceeded 90%. Chinese scholars have proposed that TCM can modulate the dysfunction of ACE2 caused by viral infection in multiple pathways. Moreover, it can inhibit ribosomal proteins to obstruct viral replication, conferring a protective effect in humans. Additionally, TCM inhibits the excessive production of activated cytokines and eliminates the inflammatory response by regulating Th17 and cytokine-related pathways, which may provide protective effects in COVID-19 patients. A recent study showed that 8 core herbal combinations and 10 new formulae were regarded as potentially useful candidates for COVID-19 treatment [108]. Lianhuaqingwen capsule, which is a repurposed marketed Chinese herb product has been confirmed for influenza treatment. A prospective multicenter open-label randomized controlled trial [109] proved that it could also be considered to ameliorate clinical symptoms of COVID-19 after 14 days of use. However, further assessment through double blind and longer follow-up duration trials is necessary.\nChloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are used for treating malaria and whether they can be a potential drug for COVID-19 treatment is currently controversial. A previous study showed that the use of chloroquine in 100 COVID-19 patients was potentially able to inhibit the virus and it was suggested to be used in clinical treatment in Chinese guideline. Hydroxychloroquine, as an analog of chloroquine, was shown to have a stronger inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 than chloroquine in vitro experiments with a higher safety. In addition, low-dose hydroxychloroquine may also play an immunoregulatory role in severely infected patients who cannot use glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants, and relieve the cytokine storm [110]. Conversely, a recent study demonstrated that there was no evidence for the efficacy of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine against COVID-19. Furthermore, it increased the risk of serious cardiac complications and mortality of patients. However, because of the high dose of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine used in this study as well as suspicion on data sources and data consistency, these results cannot be used to reach consensus. Notably, the article was retracted by Lancet [111]. Thus, the clinical value of repurposing these <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightgreen; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">drugs<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">usages</span>\n</mark> for COVID-19 <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightgreen; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">therapy<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">usages</span>\n</mark> still requires further investigation and high-quality research.\n <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightorange; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">Remdesivir<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">chemical</span>\n</mark> , an adenosine nucleotide analogue prodrug having broad-spectrum <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightgreen; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">antiviral<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">usages</span>\n</mark> activity, is expected to become a potent drug for COVID-19 [112]. However, two recent randomized controlled trials showed contradictory results. A Chinese study [113] enrolled 237 severe COVID-19 patients and demonstrated that compared with the placebo group, no improvement in mortality was found after taking remdesivir for 28 days (13.9% versus 12.8%). This study failed to complete full enrollment due to the end of the disease outbreak and 2:1 randomization in trial, leading to lower inspection efficiency, both of which may decrease credibility of the conclusion. A larger American study [114], which included 1063 patients with COVID-19, demonstrated that remdesivir was effective for treatment. It showed that median recovery time in remdesivir group was 11 days compared to 15 days in the placebo group (P < 0.001), and 14-day mortality was 7.1 and 11.9% in remdesivir group and placebo group, respectively. Researchers are optimistic regarding the use of remdesivir for COVID-19 treatment, although more clinical trials are required to provide strong evidence.\nLopinavir/Ritonavir, a kind of viral replication inhibitor, was used for SARS patients [115] and it may be effective for SARS-CoV-2 infection. A recent randomized, controlled, open-label trial [116] included 199 patients with COVID-19 and showed that the time to clinical improvement between lopinavir-ritonavir group and standard-care group was not different (HR = 1.31, 95% CI: 0.95 to 1.80). Besides, 28-day mortality was similar in the two groups, while gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in COVID-19 patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir at 400/100 mg twice daily. The trial showed disappointing results with lopinavir/ritonavir. However, patients in this study were at the late stage in infection and tissue damage had already appeared, while viral replication inhibitor is more effective in early infection, which may explain inefficacy of the treatment. In addition, Baden et al. [117] also pointed out that the concentration of the drug used in patients failed to inhibit viral replication and both groups were heterogeneous, which may lead to inaccurate conclusion. Therefore, future high-quality blind randomized clinical trials should be carried out to examine the efficacy of lopinavir/ritonavir against COVID-19.\nThere is much attention recently on the use of dexamethasone, tocilizumab and anakinra for COVID-19. In a large RECOVERY trial [118], 2100 COVID-19 patients were enrolled for evaluating the efficacy of dexamethasone for treatment. Surprisingly, it showed that dexamethasone was able to reduce mortality by up to one third in hospitalised patients with severe complication. Dexamethasone, a cheap and widely available steroid, has such a large effect on reducing mortality of COVID-19 patients and it is expected to be an effective and affordable drug for treatment. Tocilizumab, the first IL-6 receptor inhibitor has a significant effect on the treatment of COVID-19 patients. A study [119] demonstrated that tocilizumab improved the clinical outcome in severe and critical patients and it has been recommended to use in severe COVID-19 patients in China. Recently, some randomized controlled trials are being launched, which will provide a more comprehensive knowledge on the use of tocilizumab in COVID-19 patients. A retrospective study [120] with 29 COVID-19 patients found that respiratory function was improved among 72% COVID-19 patients after using high-dose anakinra. Another study [121] which enrolled 8 severe COVID-19 patients with secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis also showed the benefits of respiratory function after taking anakinra. However, lager randomized controlled trials are needed to verify the efficacy and safety of anakinra on COVID-19 patients treatment.\nCOVID-19 vaccine including nucleic acid vaccine (including mRNA vaccine, DNA vaccine), recombinant genetic engineering (protein recombinant) vaccine, inactivated vaccine, attenuated influenza virus vector vaccine, and adenovirus vector vaccine are yet to be explored [122, 123]. Faced with SARS-CoV-2 infection, global scientific researchers are stepping up the development of vaccines. Coronavirus glycoproteins are potential vaccine targets for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Due to the lack of immunological research on SARS-CoV-2 and its similarity with SARS-CoV, most studies use SARS-CoV immune information to assist the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte cell epitopes and B cell epitopes on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 are potential targets for the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine [124]. Some researchers think that the entire S protein or the S1 protein containing the RBD is an antigen that can be used for vaccine development [125]; however, some studies have pointed out that vaccines targeting antibodies against S2 linear epitopes may be more effective, because of less genetic mismatches rendering SARS-CoV-derived antibodies ineffective compared with S1 subunit [126].\nAfter the outbreak of SAR-CoV-2, at least 37 biopharmaceutical companies or academic institutions have used multiple platforms including mRNA, DNA, adenoviral vectors, and recombinant proteins to develop preventive vaccines [125]. In China, 5 vaccines (1 for adenovirus vector vaccine, 4 for inactivated vaccines) are under phase II clinical trials. Recently, Zhu et al. [127] published the first inspiring clinical result of vaccine in human. In this dose-escalation, single-center, open-label, non-randomized, phase 1 trial of an Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine, all 108 participants showed immune response after vaccination. From day 14 post-vaccination, rapid specific T-cell responses were found and peak of humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2 appeared on day 28 post-vaccination. It suggested that the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine was worth further exploration. Besides, nucleic acid-based vaccines constitute the most advanced strategy in the development of new pathogen vaccines. With the recent improvements in the stability and efficiency of protein translation and the optimization of delivery systems such as lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), nucleic acid vaccines (including DNA and RNA vaccines) are a promising approach that needs further investigation [128, 129]. However, vaccine-mediated harmful immune responses, the time and cost of research and development, the availability of large-scale production, and the ownership and management of vaccines will all be huge challenges that need to be overcome, and strengthening international cooperation is essential for accelerating research to develop new coronavirus vaccines.\nInjection of monoclonal antibodies is important for the short-term prevention of viral infections and it is used as an effective treatment upon viral infection. The SARS monoclonal antibody targets the S protein RBD on the SARS-CoV envelope. The RBDs in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV exhibit homology, prompting speculation that SARS monoclonal antibody is effective against COVID-19. A previous study determined that SARS monoclonal antibody CR3022 bound to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and the epitope of CR3022 in SARS-CoV-2 RBD did not overlap with the ACE2 binding site. It was believed that CR3022—either alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies—might act as a therapeutic candidate for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, some of the strongest SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies (such as M396 and CR3014) failed to bind to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, establishing that differences in the RBD influenced the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies [130]. It is vital to develop a new monoclonal antibody that can specifically bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD.\nFor patients with rapid disease progression, passive plasma therapy is an effective treatment. WHO recommends the use of convalescent plasma or serum to treat COVID-19 when vaccines or effective antiviral drugs are not available. In China, immune plasma therapy has been clinically effective for patients with severe COVID [131]. However, a randomized clinical trial [132] enrolled 103 patients with severe or life-threatening COVID-19 and showed that compared with the standard treatment group, there was no advancement in time to clinical improvement within 28 days after convalescent plasma therapy. This study was terminated early and was an open-label study, which may be underpowered to explore the differences in result. Further research is expected to provide a more accurate evaluation.\nAntibody-dependent enhancement is common in various viruses [133] and it is a focus for vaccine design and passive immunization. Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV RBD-specific neutralizing antibodies can mediate antibody-dependent enhancement effects [134]. Whether SARS-CoV-2 exhibits an antibody-dependent enhancement effect remains to be investigated.\nCell therapy is expected to emerge as a new way to fight SARS-CoV-2; indeed, projects on stem cell therapy for COVID-19 have been established in China (ChiCTR2000030020). Mesenchymal stem cells have immunomodulatory effects based on their location at the site of inflammation, regulating inflammation-related cytokines and reducing inflammation [135]. Via paracrine cytokines, they are expected to inhibit the cytokine storm and the overwhelming immune response caused by SARS-CoV-2. Consequently, alveolar epithelial cells and vascular endothelial cells are protected. NK cells can also improve human immunity and exert effective antiviral effects. Recently, Food and Drug Administration approved the use of mesenchymal stem cells to treat severe COVID-19 patients and clinical trial of mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of COVID-19 has also launched in the UK. However, mesenchymal stem cells and NK cells still have a long way to go before their routine use in clinics.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 induced by SARS-CoV-2 has gained much attention worldwide. By June 17, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 infection cases have occurred in as many as 216 countries, areas or territories, and a total of 8,061,550 cases have been confirmed; the scientists are now concentrated on researching the virus for a comprehensive understanding and for the development of preventive and management measures. Here, we summarized the differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV with regards to classification, amino acid composition and protein structure, and epidemiological and pathological characteristics. The pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 have been also discussed. Based on our expertise, we have focused on CVD in patients with COVID-19 and myocardial injury and VTE induced by SARS-CoV-2. Meanwhile, the information of potential medicines and therapies including TCM, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir and immunomodulatory therapy, and specific immunotherapies and cell therapy have been summarized.</br></br>UNKNOWN URL AND TITLE</br></br>Corticosteroids, particularly dexamethasone, have been the standard of care in patients with severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) since the publication of the results of the RECOVERY trial [1,2]. Other anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory therapies, such as tocilizumab and baricitinib, can be considered in patients with severe COVID-19 [2]. Remdesivir has been the only antiviral medication suggested for the treatment of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 [2].\nRemdesivir is an inhibitor of viral RNA polymerase that was initially studied on Ebola virus [3]. Remdesivir was found to have in vitro and in vivo activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has an acceptable safety profile [4,5,6]. Therefore, remdesivir was studied in large clinical trials that were initiated in the early phase of the pandemic [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. In particular, a large trial conducted by the ACTT-1 study group revealed that remdesivir was superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [4]. The results of this study led to approval by [8,9] for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. A subsequent meta-analysis of randomized trials conducted by Kaka et al. demonstrated that remdesivir may reduce mortality in patients that require supplemental oxygen but are not on mechanical ventilation [10].\nReal-world data on the efficacy of remdesivir in the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 are needed. Therefore, we performed this prospective observational study aiming to investigate the impact of remdesivir on 30-day mortality and the need for invasive and non-invasive ventilation in a large Italian institution.\nThis prospective observational study included patients admitted to Policlinico Umberto I of the University Hospital of Rome, Italy, from October 2020 to February 2021. Inclusion criteria were (1) positive SARS-CoV-2 real-time polymerase chain reaction test or antigenic test on nasopharyngeal swab, (2) pneumonia diagnosed either by thorax CT or chest x-ray, and (3) need for hospitalization. Patients who required high-flow oxygen therapy (HFNC) or non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or mechanical ventilation at the time of hospitalization were excluded from this analysis.\nAll patients were evaluated in a dedicated emergency department by dedicated infectious diseases specialists who identified patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, followed the patients during hospitalization, and collected all data prospectively without interfering with patient management. This observational study was conducted according to the principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki, and it conforms to standards currently applied in our country. This study was approved by the local EC. Informed consent was obtained from the patients.\nData were extracted from the hospital’s computerized databases and the patients’ medical records. The following data were collected: demographics, clinical and laboratory findings, comorbidities, Charlson comorbidity index, microbiologic data, date of COVID-19 diagnosis, radiological characteristics of the pneumonia, therapies used, concomitant infections, duration of mechanical ventilation, time of negative nasopharyngeal swab, need for oxygen or ventilation support during the hospital stay, length of ICU stay, and length of hospital stay. Development of moderate to severe ARDS was defined as the acute onset of hypoxemia, manifestations of pneumonia of noncardiac origin on chest computed tomography imaging, and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of less than 200 mmHg according to the Berlin definition [11].\n <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightorange; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">Remdesivir<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">chemical</span>\n</mark> was <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightgreen; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">administered<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">usages</span>\n</mark> , after written informed consent was obtained, to patients according to the following criteria: presence of pneumonia, need for low-flow oxygen therapy, less than 10 days from the onset of symptoms, no need for HFNC or NIV or mechanical ventilation, alanine aminotransferase no more than 5-fold the upper limit of the reference range, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) greater than 30 mL/min. A 5 day regimen was prescribed in all cases. Patients without these criteria were not eligible for remdesivir treatment.\nAll patients were followed until discharge or death. All discharged patients were followed for 30-days to assess outcomes.\nThe primary endpoint of this study was the impact of remdesivir-containing therapy on 30-day mortality in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV2 pneumonia. The secondary endpoint was the impact of remdesivir-containing therapy on the need for NIV or mechanical ventilation.\nTo reduce the impact of treatment selection bias in the estimation of treatment effects, propensity score matching was conducted with the nearest neighbor matching procedure without replacement [12]. Variables were selected for inclusion in the propensity score based on the potential impact on receipt of remdesivir and the association with mortality [13]. The variables included were steroids, antibiotics (excluding macrolides), age, gender, oxygen, comorbidities, CRP concentrations and the use of LMWH during hospital admission. A propensity score density plot and a Love plot were generated to examine the balance of propensity score and covariate distribution between the two groups (see Supplementary Figure S1).\nTo evaluate the demographic factors, Welch’s t-test assuming unequal variances was used for continuous independent variables, while Pearson’s Chi-square or Fisher’s exact test was used, where appropriate, for categorical variables. Welch’s analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to assess group differences for continuous outcomes. Welch’s t-test assuming unequal variances was used for post hoc comparisons.\nAll tests were two tailed, and a p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results are expressed as the mean with standard deviation (±SD) for continuous normally distributed variables and as a count (n) and percentage (%) for categorical variables. Multivariate analysis was used to identify independent predictors of 30-day mortality and the need for NIV or mechanical ventilation. Matched bivariate analysis was conducted using a conditional logistic regression model, incorporating all variables found to be significant in the univariate analysis (p < 0.05) with a stepwise method. Matched multivariate models were constructed using Cox proportional hazard (HR) regression if appropriate, accounting for clustering of matched pairs. The final selected model was tested for confounding. In addition, a 95% confidence interval was calculated for HR. Survival was analyzed by Kaplan–Meier curves. All data were analyzed using a commercially available statistical software package (SPSS Statistics for Mac, 22.0; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).\nDuring the study period, 407 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were consecutively enrolled. Out of these, 294 (72.2%) were treated with remdesivir and or 113 (27.8%) were not (control group). The mean time for remdesivir administration was 5.2 days (±2.9) from the onset of symptoms. Overall, 61 patients (14.9%) were treated during hospitalization with HFNC, NIV, or mechanical ventilation, and the 30-day mortality rate was 5.2% (21 patients).\nTable 1 reports the univariate analysis of demographics and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients treated with remdesivir or not. Statistically significant differences were observed in the remdesivir group with regard to male sex (80% vs. 62%, p < 0.001), fever (79% vs. 50%, p < 0.001), cough (50% vs. 29%, p < 0.001), and dyspnea (57% vs. 37%, p < 0.001) compared to patients in the control group. No statistically significant differences were observed in the remdesivir group with regard to age (63.2 vs. 62.5 years, p = 0.717), and days to negative nasopharyngeal swab (22.07 vs. 24.77 days, p = 0.378).\nIn-hospital treatments for COVID-19 patients are reported in Table 2. A comparison between patients treated with remdesivir or not shows that steroids (93% vs. 81%, p < 0.001) and LMWH (93% vs. 52%, p < 0.001) were more frequently prescribed in the remdesivir group; antibiotic therapy (58% vs. 27%, p < 0.001) was more frequently prescribed for patients in the control group; and no differences were reported regarding the use of HFNC/NIV or mechanical ventilation in the two study groups.\nIn Table 3 are reported outcomes of hospitalized patients in the two study groups. No statistically significant differences were observed about length of hospital stay (15.02 vs. 16.06 days, p = 0.487), bacterial co-infection (20% vs. 21%, p = 0.928), and 30-day mortality (4% vs. 6%, p = 0.411).\nSupplementary Tables S1 and S2 reports the results of univariate analysis before and after propensity score matching to evaluate the impact of the remdesivir-containing regimen on the study population. Figure 1 shows Kaplan–Meier curves for 30-day survival of patients treated with remdesivir or not before (p = 0.24) and after (p = 0.88) propensity score matching, showing no differences between the 2 study groups. Standardized differences before and after propensity score matching are reported in Supplementary Figure S1.\nMultivariate Cox regression analysis of 30-day mortality after propensity score matching is reported in Table 4. Therapies, including remdesivir-containing therapy, were not statistically associated with 30-day survival or mortality. However, mechanical ventilation (HR 4.22, 95% CI 5.4–16.2, p = 0.003) was independently associated with 30-day mortality.\nFinally, multivariate Cox regression was used to analyze the need for non-invasive or invasive ventilation after propensity score matching (see Table 5). The data show that comorbidities and therapies, including the remdesivir-containing regimen, were not independently associated with a lower or higher risk of needing HFNC/NIV or mechanical ventilation.\nThis prospective clinical study reports a real-life experience with the use of remdesivir in a large population of consecutively hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Our data, also after propensity score matching, show that the remdesivir-containing regimen was not associated with 30-day patient survival compared to treatment with other therapies not including remdesivir. Moreover, the remdesivir-containing regimen was not independently related to the need for HFNC/NIV or mechanical ventilation.\nIn Italy, remdesivir was specifically licensed for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients with pneumonia who require oxygen therapy but not HFNC/NIV or mechanical ventilation at the time of remdesivir prescription [14].\nDifferent data were reported around the world regarding the efficacy of remdesivir, taking into account different outcomes. In patients with severe COVID-19, treatment with remdesivir was significantly associated with higher recovery rates and lower mortality compared to standard-of-care treatment without remdesivir [15]. In this study, the mortality rate was significantly lower for patients treated with remdesivir (7.6%) compared with control groups (12.5%). Conversely, data from the Solidarity trial, conducted in 30 countries [16], showed no decrease in in-hospital mortality in patients treated with remdesivir, with the important limitation that other outcomes (clinical improvement and adverse events) were not carefully evaluated.\nRecent real-word studies reporting data on the use of remdesivir [17] also compared it with lopinavir/ritonavir [18]. Some important meta-analysis showed that COVID-19 patients receiving remdesivir showed significantly higher rates of recovery and hospital discharge with lower rates of serious adverse events when compared to patients receiving other treatments [19,20]. However, these analyses also noted that there were no significant differences in clinical improvement and rate of mortality during hospitalization. Specifically, mortality was the main outcome reported in all analyzed studies, which showed no significant decrease in mortality if they were not adequately powered for this outcome [12].\nWang et al. [21] reported the first double-blind randomized clinical trial evaluating patients with a mean interval from symptom onset to enrollment of 12 days. No differences in mortality were recorded in the two arms, and the authors highlighted a possible trend of clinical benefit in patients treated with remdesivir. Of importance, a large number of patients in this study were also treated with steroids (65% in the remdesivir arm and 68% in the placebo arm), which may have confounded the results and conclusions. A strength of our study, with the limitation of the non-randomized cohort, was weighting all possible therapeutic confounders, including the use of steroids and LMWH [22,23].\nBeigel et al. [7] randomized 1062 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and evidence of pneumonia to remdesivir or placebo. This study demonstrated that remdesivir was superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery in COVID-19 patients, with a trend toward survival benefit at day 29, without statistically significant differences. Of interest, the authors reported a beneficial effect of remdesivir in severe COVID-19 patients who did not require mechanical ventilation at enrollment; they suggested to start remdesivir early in the disease course.\nFinally, in another randomized clinical trial [24] of patients with low to moderate COVID-19 (no oxygen requirement, but about 15% of patients required oxygen at the time of enrollment), the authors randomized 596 patients in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a 5 day or 10 day course of remdesivir or standard-of-care therapy. The 5 day, but not the 10 day treatment showed a statistically significant difference with regard to the main clinical outcome. In the analysis, excluding patients who required oxygen at baseline, statistically significant differences favoring remdesivir over standard care were reported.\nOur study has some limitations. First, considering the monocentric design, these results might be affected by local practice in the management of COVID-19. Second, although the criteria for HFNC/NIV and mechanical ventilation were based on the degree of respiratory impairment, critically ill elderly patients with ultimately fatal diseases were probably excluded from non-invasive/invasive ventilation, modifying the interpretation of some interventions; moreover, the small sample size did not permit definitive conclusions, including about HFNC/NIV and mechanical ventilation (only 61 patients were analyzed) and some important variables (like body mass index [BMI]) were not available for all study population. Third, this analysis evaluated consecutively hospitalized patients independently from COVID-19 severity, as demonstrated by the low mortality rate (6% of remdesivir group vs. 4% of those not treated with remdesivir). Finally, the analysis of the beneficial effects of treatments should be interpreted cautiously because it was not conducted with randomized groups and might therefore be affected by several measured and unmeasured confounding factors. However, the comparison of patients treated and not treated with remdesivir was based on a robust statistical methodology appropriate for non-randomized cohort studies about therapy.\nIn conclusion, in this real-life experience, the use of remdesivir in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was not associated with significantly increased rates of survival or reduced use of HFNC/NIV or mechanical ventilation compared to treatment with other therapies not including remdesivir. These results suggest the need to conduct other RCTs to evaluate the impact of remdesivir in hospitalized COVID-19 patients at different stages of the disease or in combination with other drugs [5]. However, considering its safety profile and the lack of alternative drugs, remdesivir should continue to be administered for patients with COVID-19.</br></br>UNKNOWN URL AND TITLE</br></br>The COVID-19 infection is rapidly spreading over the world and more than 210 countries are struggling with this mysterious and deadly novel virus [1]. There is no specific effective treatment and optimized supportive care is indicated for the patients. In situations like this, off-lab indications, dosage regimens, routes of administration, or group of patients specified in the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) approved labeling [2].

Despite the existing information on COVID-19 and its high mortality in the elderly with pre-existing comorbidities [4], in Iran, the mortality rate is higher than China (6.2% versus 4%) [5]; however, the relative frequency of death is higher (45.1%) in patients with at least one comorbidity [6]. Thus, extraordinary efforts are made to rescue those patients. Several medications were recommended in the different versions of “Iran’s Flowchart for Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19” since the beginning of the outbreak including oseltamivir, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir+ritonavir, ribavirin, and atazanavir [7]. Also, lots of unjustified other medications such as biologics (tocilizumab), high dose vitamin C, remdesivir and favipiravir are recommended and even prescribed in patients with COVID-19 [8–11]. To our knowledge, none of these indications are approved and they are administered as off-label medications.\nWe are all aware that physicians are in the front line of encountering COVID-19 and they are sacrificing their valuable health and life. Also, we believe that they are doing their best for their patients to bring back health and wellbeing. They may apply so many different off-label medications even the ones with the weakest evidence in hope of rescuing COVID-19 positive patients, whose life is seriously threatening. Doing so could be in contrast to the physician’s professional commitments because they professionally promised to save patients’ life while not harm. In this viewpoint, we aim at taking a brief look at the common national and international regulations (designed by developed countries) of off-label uses and then stating the ethical challenges of off-label administrations in the COVID-19 outbreak for better perception and responsible implication. Furthermore, we have some recommendations to overcome the obstacles.\nConducting biomedical research on off-label medications needs considering definite ethical and scientific principles, ethical guidelines as well as ethical approval even in disasters such as COVID-19 outbreak. To our knowledge, there was no international [16] or national code to address the ethical considerations of research on off-label medications in disasters such as the COVID-19 outbreak except for USFDA; however, the “Ministry of Health and Medical Education” of Iran released the “Instruction on Conducting Clinical Trials in COVID-19 Pandemic” in March 2020 about one month after emerging COVID-19 [17].\nUSFDA considers the investigational use of off-label medications different from clinical practice. Based on USFDA regulation, investigational use of off-label medications helps the development of their safety and efficacy which needs to be used in the context of a clinical study protocol [18]. In COVID-19 pandemic USFDA released a new guideline entitled “FDA Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during the COVID-19 Pandemic”, in which the most prominent necessity to be saved has been considered as patients safety; all existing regulatory requirements are mandatory as well [19].\nThe investigational post-approval trials for unapproved indications may induce widespread use of a drug despite lack of enough confirmatory evidence [20] which may increase the rate of adverse drug events [21].\nIn the crisis like the COVID-19 outbreak, off-label drugs may be administered as clinical practice based on the physicians’ responsibility. This strategy may create innovation in clinical practice especially when the disease is novel and unknown; likewise, it presents earlier access to potentially efficient medications and authorizes the physicians to pursue new modalities based on new evidence [22].\nUSFDA regulations accept using off-label medications as the “practice of medicine”; accordingly, this application does not need to be submitted for approval [18].\nThe WHO guideline accepts off-label prescription as legal action if it follows ethical guidelines and safety regulations [4]. In the UK, prescribing off-label medications is legally accepted by a registered prescriber, however, the healthcare professionals may have more responsibility in prescribing off-label than on-label medications [23].\nPrescribing off-label medications in clinical practice may provide the only available hope for this condition; however, there are some ethical issues to be regarded.\nThe choice of off-label medications is more complicated when there is less clear-cut evidence and, in this situation, the ethical issues are come to practice. At this condition, the cooperation of the physicians with clinical pharmacists and the hospital ethics committee is a piece of reasonable advice to fill the translational gap in evidence and clinical practice. This approach is in agreement with Helsinki Declaration 2013 that recommends to the physicians seeking expert advice, and obtaining patients informed consent in using unproven interventions in clinical practice for saving a life [24].\nThe patients have the right to access effective and safe drugs but not the most effective and safe drugs which are not feasible. The public needs safer and more effective drugs which are supported by strong evidence; however, off-label use may not meet these criteria. To determine the ethical acceptability of off-label medications, their efficacy and safety should be compared to other options including supportive measures based on beneficence and non-maleficence. Being encountered with such a devastating pandemic, not having approved medications, and not sufficiently knowing about the virus and its behavior as well as time shortage for treatment, led to hurriedly decision making and discrepancies in treatment modalities. For example, in Iran, the first “Flowcharts for Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19” recommended oseltamivir for in/outpatient treatment [7, 25] while the recommendation was removed after three weeks of prescription due to lack of strong evidence on its efficacy [26]; likewise, the WHO stated that “oseltamivir is not proven to be effective for COVID-19” in April 2020 [27].\nObserving justice in resource allocation necessitates considering pharmacoeconomic issues more important especially when clinical trials or clinical practice of some newer highly expensive medications such as tocilizumab or favipiravir are on the way; otherwise it may cause financial loss and a high burden on the health system. Furthermore, it may cause an inductive demand in the population for receiving those drugs at high prices as a rescue agent while its safety and efficacy have not been confirmed.\nAlthough the physicians’ autonomy allows them to prescribe off-label medications, off-label use of drugs in the COVID-19 outbreak may be a part of drug manufacturers for marketing promotion while the physicians mostly are not aware of that.\nRegarding the patient’s autonomy, there will be another concern about whether or not the physician should inform the patient about the off-label status of the prescribed medications. From one side and especially in the crisis like the COVID-19 outbreak, there is no time for disclosure and/or patient informed consent. Further, it depends on the physicians-patients relationship and the mutual trust which necessitates physicians action based on patients best interest. In the COVID-19 outbreak, mostly there is a short interval between the patient’s deterioration and death, so, there is no time for a proper physician-patient relationship to get formed, again, there is no time for the physician to become aware of the patient’s interests.\nFrom the other point of view, revealing the information to the patient may create skepticism on drugs safety and efficacy and increase patient’s anxiety and probably non-compliance. The problem becomes more complicated when the physician knows that there is little chance for saving patients’ life and he should provide compassionate and respectful care in association with supporting the patient’s family and informing them. In these situations consultation with the ethics committee would be of benefit; however, because of time shortage, decisions mostly depend on the physician’s point of view and his perception of the patient; thus, the physicians are responsible for their decision and should be accountable.\nUnfortunately, in the COVID-19 outbreak, we are observing the third type of off-label uses which seems to be something in between- a kind of trial and error; we call it pseudo-research. The term pseudo-research was previously used by Bowbrick in marketing in that poor scientific method combined with good experimental technique and generates little value [28]. Likewise, we would like to define pseudo-research as using off-label medications in clinical practice without obtaining the patient’s informed consent, and finally publishing the results of drug efficacy as a research article. From the research point of view, because, there is no proposal, the validity of the method is under question, the results are of little value. This manner could be considered unethical research because the first ethical consideration [29] which is the research validity is not perceived. Furthermore, the patients informed consent is waived without the permission of the ethics committee. Also, the sample size is limited; so, the generalizability of the results is under question. In pseudo-research, the researcher who is the main healthcare provider may have confirmation bias because he would like to obtain positive results following his off-label intervention. The confirmation bias is a kind of cognitive bias and the researcher tries to interpret the data by his assumptions and not based on the scientific evidence. Besides, the designation of the pseudo-research may be based on unjustified objectives; so, logical error forms and transfers to others by paper publication.\nThe other possible negative impact of pseudo-research are including imposing real harms either on the patients or on the future generations, not informing the patients and not obtaining informed consent or undue inducement of informed consent, the probability of bias in sampling, not compensating the harms of the study to the affected patients, having no ethical approval; also, these interventions may accelerate patients death and make the disease worse. Therefore, two scenarios are possible: spontaneous patients recovery which may account for the effectiveness of the off-label intervention or increasing disease severity which may account for the disease progression. The motivation for publishing the resulted data is very high because it helps the authors to become well-reputed, and the paper could be fast-tracked.\nThe pseudo-research is mostly done by physicians whose first responsibility is clinical practice.\nThe physicians argue that we should rescue patients in any possible way, COVID-19 is a subtype of the coronavirus family, so, probably the effective medications on this family are effective in COVID-19 and if we find the solution we would be of great help to the human being.\nIn general, pseudo-research is unethical and non-scientific; however, promoting or acting on an exception to overcoming an outbreak is anticipated to perform perfectly or to develop an ideal outcome.\nNo doubt publishing the data of scientific research especially in the COVID-19 outbreak is something of practical value. The possibility of generating a worth-while piece of information is probably high, but not having a well-defined proposal and scientific method of research, the physician will lose all perspective as to what his practical ability is. This could be considered as an unintentional mistake and a part of a larger mistake, which comes from a general misinterpretation that has tended to publish every set of data obtained in clinical practice as a research article.\nThe immaturity of the pseudo-research and its resultant paper will hurt the research body of every health system. So, the health system should take the necessary care to help the physicians do the research sufficiently simple and well organized within the national and international regulatory bodies in outbreak conditions. To do this, the national and international regulatory bodies such as USFDA, and EU, as well as the national ones such as the National Committee of Ethics in Biomedical Research of Iran, should step out of their routine and codify a range of guidelines to address therapeutic and/or investigational use of off-label medications by highlighting the safety concerns of the off-label uses as well as respecting patients autonomy especially in critical situations such as the COVID-19 outbreak.\nAlso, we recommend the healthcare providers to make informed decisions on using off-label medications in biomedical research and/or clinical practice. As a clinical practice, they should take the responsibility of using off-label medications by respecting the health system and its regulations and being accountable to both the health system and patients. By this approach, the health system will permit and will audit off-label medication administration under tight regulations and based on enough clinical evidence as well as the mutual trust in between which could be the standard practice. However, the physicians should be careful that the information about the efficacy and safety of off-label medication in clinical practice should not be published as a research article.</br></br>UNKNOWN URL AND TITLE</br></br>The ongoing COVID-19 (SARS-COV-2 infection) crisis is an unprecedented public health challenge as there are no clinically-proven interventions with substantial evidence that can effectively manage the infection. To meet this challenge, researchers around the world have been working diligently on developing new treatment plans or drugs. Several clinical interventions including those that involve the use of convalescent plasma, a combination of existing drugs, or repurposed drugs, have either entered the clinical trial phase or completed small size studies (a partial list of drugs/therapies used for COVID-19 <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightgreen; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">treatment<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">usages</span>\n</mark> is given in the appendix).

In general, COVID-19 research has been criticized for being non-rigorous [3] and many clinical trials have shown uncertain results due to various reasons, including missing or inappropriate control group, small sample size and/or rigorous statistical designs [4–8]. Hydroxyquinone, for example, found to be effective in a small clinical trial [9] failed to show efficacy in a larger trial [10]. Likewise, the trial on Lopinavir-Ritonavir in adults with COVID-19 concluded that “future trials in patients with severe illness may help to confirm or exclude the possibility of a treatment benefit” [8].\nKey reasons for the failure of approaches attempted so far are the uniqueness and the range of the population affected by COVID-19 compared with clinical trials with other populations, as well as the speed at which such trials must be conducted. Clearly, there is urgent need for conducting well-designed and well-powered clinical evaluation of potential COVID-19 therapies. However, with patients showing up with a variety of characteristics and fast changing status, it is difficult to recruit and conduct an appropriate trial that could best show the effectiveness of an intervention. Many factors, such as patient status, age, sex, race, co-morbidity, etc., can affect the design or the outcome of the trial and therefore these features must be taken into consideration as stratification factors in designing a well-powered study. Moreover, because of rapid changes in infection rates in a particular location, there is only a limited window of opportunity to conduct single-site clinical trials [11]. Therefore, a wide set of such factors, and a rapidly changing patient population, make it challenging to develop a design that minimizes the imbalance in treatment allocation with respect to stratification factors, while ensuring that the number of strata remain manageable.\nThe World Health Organization has established an ordinal scale system to best describe the clinical status of a patient [12]. A similar 7-category ordinal scale has been used in a previous trial [8]. This scale has proven to be an effective in describing the severity of illness as well as in assessing clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients. This 7-category ordinal scale has been used recently by Wang et al., [13] to categorize outcomes in patients hospitalized with seasonal influenza infection. The authors found the scale to be a useful in capturing a broad range of clinical states as well as in tracking a patient’s status change. Although the ordinal scale is useful for patient classification, but because of differing responses it is not efficient to design a trial based on every stage. Also, patients at different stages of the disease require different treatment. Therefore, we combined groups with potentially similar responses and treatment methods together. The details of this World Health Organization ordinal scale are given in Table 1. Stage 0 is not included here because the uninfected population is not of interest in the context of a clinical trial.\n\nA composite endpoint is a single measure of effect, based on a combination of individual components endpoints. Composite endpoints have high utility in evaluating the efficacy of therapeutic interventions that could individually or concurrently alter several different symptoms or outcomes. For example, in Type II diabetics, a drug may affect HbA1C (hemoglobin A1C), body weight, and systolic blood pressure [14]. Often, the frequency of events in individual components of a composite endpoint may be low, so several components are combined to assess the overall efficacy of an intervention. However, each component of a composite endpoint should be clinically meaningful. Ideally, all component should be weighted equally, but this is rarely possible, therefore the relative importance of the components may have to be determined by the frequency of occurrence of the component outcomes. For instance, in cardiovascular trials - death, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, coronary revascularization and hospitalization for angina are commonly combined, although fatal and non-fatal events are not be treated as the same. In a recent study, patients and clinical trial authors, when asked to assign “spending weights” to five events - death, myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization and hospitalization for angina, assigned different weights to each of these components [15].\nIn trials where death is a possible outcome, it is often included as a part of a composite outcome to capture the overall efficacy of the treatment. In this regard, the statistical theory of competing risk supports the inclusion mortality as a component of a composite outcome [16]. In a review of 14 journals between January 2000 to January 2007, of the 1231 cardiovascular trials, 37% used composite endpoints, and 98% of these trials included mortality as a component [17].\nIn our study design, we selected the 15th day to determine the patient’s status because the 14-day period is the mean duration for patient recovery, or a complete cycle of treatment, as shown in Cao et al. [8]. A 14 day follow up has been used in other studies as well [10]. The estimated mean duration of hospital stay among survivors in the US is 9.3 days (with 95% staying 0.8 to 32.9 days) and among non-survivors was 12.7 days (1.6 to 37.7 days) [18]. Likewise, systemic review of 52 studies, showed that the median length of stay in China was 10–19 days, and 5 (interquartile range: 3–9) outside China [19]. Therefore, a 14-day follow-up is likely to be sufficient for evaluating efficacy. Other useful values (median days) adopted from Cao’s manuscript are:\nTime to Clinical Improvement -----------------16 Days\nIntensive Care Unit (ICU) Length of Stay------10 Days\nDuration of Invasive Mechanical Ventilation (IMV)-5 Days\nDays on Oxygen Support------------------------13 Days\nLength of Hospitalization------------------------15 Days\nThe WHO has proposed time to clinical improvement as the primary endpoint in the R&D blueprint report [12]. The “time to clinical improvement” is defined by Cao [8] as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a 7-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever comes first. However, based on conversations with more than 50 frontline physicians, we believe that the WHO endpoint may not be the best choice. The reason is that the authors do not feel that in the intermediate-risk group the time it takes for a patient to be cured, whether it is 15 days or 18 days, is important. What is of greater interest is acceptable recovery from the infection (‘full cure’), therefore, we propose a binary outcome to be the endpoint (whether the patient is cured after 14 days or not). The intent is identify the increase in response rate in the intermediate group with new treatment compared with standard care. The duration to evaluate the efficacy in the high-risk group is short, and there is no censoring, and no loss to follow-up. In the high-risk group, the most important outcome is survival. Therefore, we chose 30 day mortality as the primary outcome and do not suggest using a time-to-event approach for designing the trial.\nThe endpoints used in other published studies are: time to providing a nasopharyngeal swab negative RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 [6], incidence of either laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 or illness compatible with COVID-19 within 14 days [10], reduction in mortality by at least 50% in the high-dose group compared with the low-dose group [5], presence or absence of virus at day 6 [4], all-cause mortality at hospital discharge or at 60 days, and the WHO clinical progression scale [20].\nCore Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) initiative started on May 20-21st, 2015 in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Since then many efforts are underway to develop Core Outcome Set (COS) for various indications including COVID-19 [21, 22]. For COVID-19 disease prevention, efforts are underway to develop COS and for in hospitalized patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. Jin et al. have developed COS for mild (time to 2019—nCOV reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) negativity), ordinary type (length of hospital stay, severe type (composite events, length of hospital stay, PAO2/FiO2, duration of mechanical ventilation and time to 2019-nCoV negativity), critical type (all-cause mortality) and rehabilitation (pulmonary function) [22]. The WHO group on COS in COVID-19 categorized COS outcome into three categories: Viral burden (PCR or nasopharyngeal swab), survival (All-cause mortality at hospital discharge or at 60 days) and clinical progression - WHO clinical progression scale measured daily over the course of the study [20]. Hospital discharge and mortality are both part of COS for COVID-19. Hospital discharge is around 15 days [23, 24]. The endpoint we have proposed are in line with the COMET initiative.\nThe purpose of this article is to propose effective statistical designs for COVID-19 clinical trials. Two parallel clinical trials design with respect to different patient risk groups are described. Issues and limitations are discussed. Required sample size in each arm under different scenarios along with toxicity boundaries are calculated and presented in a tabular form for ease of implementation and to inform clinical trial designs.\nSince a larger number of patients are expected in the intermediate-risk group, it is feasible to use binary endpoints (success or failure).\nWe define Y as the primary response variable based on the proportion of patients discharged from hospital by the 15th day. Let Y = 1 indicate the success outcome if the patient is discharged from the hospital by the 15th day. Let Y = 0 indicate the failure if the patient is not discharged from the hospital by the 15th day, transiting to a higher WHO scale, or dead. Here, the failure is a composite endpoint. It is the similar logic adopted from the cardiovascular trials mentioned in the background section. In our case, Y = 1 is the success with probability P and Y = 0 is the failure with probability 1-P. Accordingly, we calculated results based on the improvement of response rate from 40% in the standard arm to various rates (50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%) in the treatment arm.\nSome secondary outcome variables might also be considered. For example, the change in viral load or biomarkers of inflammation such as ferritin or IL-6, time to reduced viral load, or the number of event-free days in the hospital (event-free survival).\nFor ethical reason, group sequential designs are recommended in the current setting. Since many factors could impact the outcome, stratified randomization is more suitable. For doing so, Zelen’s blocked randomization scheme with random block size (randomly selected size 4 or 6) is suggested [25]. In previous work Srivastava et al. [26] found that, with several factors appearing to affect the primary outcome of interest with their true distributions being unknown, or the possibility of causing heterogeneous treatment response among individuals in a group with unknown effect size, stratified randomization approach offered consistently better results if the effect size can be assumed to be marginally similar within each stratum.\nFactors, such as age, race, sex, co-morbidity and viral load, which might impact the primary outcomes could be addressed by stratification. However, choosing the right factor for stratification is critically important. Many different issues need to be considered when choosing stratification factors. Based on the current clinical experience showing a strong dependence of COVID-19 outcomes on age, sex and diabetes, obesity and hypertension [27, 28], we consider four such factors for the intermediate-risk group: patient stage, at least one cardiovascular disease risk factor among obesity, hypertension and diabetes (Yes/No), age (< 60 and ≥ 60 years), and sex (Male/Female).\nFor the intermediate risk group, we further classified patients in the three stages, those in Stages 3 and 4 and those in Stage 5 (essentially classifying patients into those who are not in ICU vs. those who are in ICU) and grouping them into two groups. This is suggested to minimize the number of strata for randomization while ensuring that patients within each stratum are relatively homogenous. All these factors are readily identifiable; however, for defining metabolic syndrome status, it may be necessary to include other factors that are representative of a patient’s health condition. Alternatively, composite risk scores such as the Framingham, Reynolds, or GRACE risk scores may be used. Data to calculate cardiovascular risk score and/or obesity may be readily available, as patients are usually weighed and their blood pressure, cholesterol status, and diabetes are often known upon hospital admission. Although age is usually included in risk factor score, it could also be considered as a separate variable when the risk score cannot be calculated. Assuming that no risk scores are available, in our recommended design, we define two age groups: less than 60 years of age and greater than or equal to 60 years of age. It is generally known that patients in the intermediate-risk group are mostly elderly. Patients less than 50 years of age only count a very small percent of the patients admitted to a hospital. Therefore, the cutoff line at 60 years of age is selected to have balanced strata. Moreover, in view of studies showing that the recovery rate for males is lower than of females [29], sex should also be considered. With these four factors for stratification, there would be a total of 16 strata in the design, which makes the trial design somewhat manageable. Race is not explicitly considered, as there is no indication yet of race-dependent variations in outcome, independent of pre-existing disease burden.\nFor the intermediate-risk group, two interim analyses are recommended. Results are presented for no interim analysis, one interim analysis and two interim analyses. We describe design parameters at alpha = 0.05 and power = 90%. Because the virus is life threatening, it is important to ascertain the efficacy of the intervention as early as possible and make the drug available to this patient population as soon as possible. Without interim analysis, researchers would know the outcome of the trials only after all patients have been enrolled. If one choose to perform one interim analysis, when 50% of patients are enrolled, then using G-rho spending function with rho equals 2, one would stop the trial at the interim evaluation if the p-value of the test for comparing the two groups is less than 0.006 [30, 31]. Additionally, for futility evaluation, trial would also be stopped if the p-value is greater than 0.716. Otherwise, the trial should continue, and the final analysis will be conducted, and the efficacy of the treatment should be declared only if when the p-value is less than 0.047. However, due to the insidious nature of this infection, waiting until 50% of patients enrolled to find out the result may still not be aggressive enough. Therefore, to fast track the process and to ensure that the drug can be made available to those who need it urgently, we recommend two interim analyses, with first interim analysis to be performed when one-third of total patient population has been enrolled and evaluated (effective new treatment if p < 0.002) with futility look at p > 0.830; second look being performed when two-third of the patients are enrolled and evaluated (effective treatment if p < 0.014) with futility look at p > 0.298; and the final analysis when all patients are enrolled (p < 0.046). Rho equals three is used in the G-rho spending function [30, 31]. The choice of Rho was based on the consideration that we need to make the drug available to the patients quickly but we need to make sure that the trial is stopped early only if we have strong evidence that the drug is effective. This is the reason why we chose the p-values cut-offs at interim evaluations to be somewhat conservative (making sure that there is strong evidence in favor of the drug and avoid false positive findings). To explain with an example, assume the overall sample size is 243 in which 81 belongs to the standard care arm and the rest 162 belongs to the treatment arm. At the first interim analysis, we have 54 patients (one third of 162). If p < 0.002, then there is strong evidence to declare that the intervention is working, and the trial should stop right away. With this design, researchers can find out early whether the intervention works, or stop, if it is causing unacceptable harm to patients by monitoring toxicities. Considering some unforeseen reasons (e.g., patients change their mind regarding the study after randomization) the sample size should be increased by approximately 5% with resulting total n = 256. If the expected effect is somewhat smaller (such as 10%), the sample size will drastically increase (n = 978), however, the monitoring rule for efficacy and futility evaluations remains the same.\nWe calculate here sample sizes for both 1:1 and 1:2 randomizations for the intermediate-risk group. However, patients enrolled in treatment arm may be the same or twice the number of patients enrolled in the standard treatment arm. The choice of group ratio depends on the efficacy of the intervention in the pilot studies. If it is a new intervention that has not been approved by the FDA, then 1:1 randomization with block size of 4 is recommended in consideration of patient safety. If it is an approved procedure or drug with some preliminary data on efficacy with known toxicity profile, then 1:2 randomization with block size of 6 is recommended to ensure that if the drug is effective more patients get the advantage of being treated on the more efficacious arm.\nToxicity monitoring is challenging, but necessary. For the intermediate-risk group, a toxicity rate of 25% is recommended due to the urgent need of drugs for treatment. In other words, if intervention provides even minimal improvement, then it should still be considered as there is currently no known drug that is 100% effective against COVID-19. Also note that patient may die during the treatment due to other causes. We recommend monitoring for those toxicities (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grades > 2) that are related, possibly related and probably related to the drug, evaluated by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) [32].\nThe number of patients in the high-risk group at each health care facility is likely to be small. Using time-to-survival as an endpoint may not be ideal because the follow-up is short, and it may require a long time to enroll all patients and there would hardly be any right censoring. In other words, very few patients will survive pass the outcome evaluation time, thereby making time-to-survival as an endpoint ineffective. Therefore, in our design we focused on reducing 30 day mortality rate. Note that since there is no censoring and the length of follow-up is very short in this risk group, there is almost no difference between the choices of survival or binary endpoints [33].\nWe define the 30 days mortality as the primary outcome. Let Y = 1 indicate death of patient within 30 days (failure), and Y = 0 represents a person still alive on the 30th day (success). Accordingly, we calculated results based on the reduction of mortality rate from 80% or 70% in the standard arm to various rates (70%, 65%, 60%, 55%, 50%, 45%, 40%, 35%) in the treatment arm.\nFor the high-risk group, stratification is recommended as sample size is satisfied when using 30 day mortality as primary outcome. Enrolling sufficient patients within a given timeframe should not be an issue assuming the trial is a multi-center trial.\nFor stratification, similar factors as discussed for the intermediate-risk group design are recommended, with some modification. We consider three factors for the high-risk group: one cardiovascular disease risk factors, such as diabetes, hypertension, and obesity (Yes/No), age (< 65 and ≥ 65 years), and sex (male/female). With these three factors for stratification, there would be a total of 8 strata in the design. The reason of selecting 65 years age as a cutoff point is that in a recent study of COVID-19, mortality rate for those who received mechanical ventilation in the age of 18 to 65 years was 76.4%, and for those over 65 years of age, the mortality rate was 97.2% [34]. Zelen’s blocked randomization scheme with random block size (randomly chose size 4 or 6) is recommended in this risk group [25].\nIn the high-risk group, we did not further classify patients based on their stages (Stage 6 and 7) as we have done in the intermediate-risk group. The reason is that the number of patients in stage 7 is likely to be small, and it is not possible to stratify based on these two stages. However, technically it is ideal to stratify patients evenly in every arm based on their stages, but that is not achievable in this case. Since we have chosen other factors for stratification, if extreme bias occurs, then stage 7 patients should be dropped, and researchers should only perform analysis on stage 6 patients with 80% power.\nFor the high-risk group, two interim analyses along with monitoring for efficacy and futility at overall alpha = 0.05 and power = 90% are recommended. The reason is that the mortality rate in these patients is high and they need some innovative treatments. For example, convalescent plasma therapy has been widely attempted among the high-risk group. However, the levels of neutralizing antibodies in specific plasma preparation are likely to vary, leading to variable outcomes. Therefore, if during two interim analyses patients respond better to plasma with specific antibody titers, then the rest of the patients could be moved to the higher quality plasma quickly, so they have a higher chance of survival. In this design, first interim analysis is to be performed when one-third of total patient population has been enrolled, completed 30 days, and evaluated (effective new treatment if p < 0.002) with futility look at p > 0.830; second look being performed when two-third of the patients are enrolled, completed 30 days, and evaluated (p < 0.014) with futility look at p > 0.298; and the final analysis when all patients are enrolled and completed 30 days (p < 0.046). Rho equals three is used in the G-rho spending function based on the consideration of being more conservative in interim analyses to ensure that the treatment is efficacious and avoid the chances of falsely declaring the treatment to be efficacious, which could mean heavy losses in terms of resources invested and loss of lives. Sample sizes for one interim analysis are also calculated and are given in Tables 8 and 9 in the appendix for reference.\nFor patients in the high-risk group, 1:2 randomization is recommended, because such patients are in danger and possibly have failed other treatments. Hence, they should be treated with whatever intervention available to improve their chances of survival. In addition, sample size is large enough to handle the 1:2 treatment allocation ratio when expecting a reduction of mortality rate from 70% to 55%. Estimated sample sizes for 1:1 randomization are also calculated and provided in the appendix for reference.\nFor the high-risk group, no toxicity monitoring is necessary since mortality rate (between 70% and 97%) has been reported across many health care facilities. With such a high death rate, it is not necessary to look at the toxicity level. Any reasonable intervention that could increase the chances of saving a patient should be attempted, regardless of treatable toxicities. In addition, two interim analyses are built in our design to help stop the trial early if any harmful events are detected.\nIn the intermediate-risk group, we assume the baseline success rate is 40% in the standard arm (Standard Care) and increased success rate in the treatment group. This estimate is based on a study showing that 38% patients requiring mechanical ventilation were discharged alive [34]. However, these data are from New York during the most severe phase of the outbreak. The baseline success in this group may be higher and therefore the study design could be modified accordingly. It may also be noted that assuming a baseline response rate of 40% provides a conservative estimate of the samples size and to detect the same effect size (for example, 20%) the power would be enhanced if the baseline response rate is lower than 40%. In other words, sample size would not change much whether the baseline success rate is 30%, 40%, or 50%.\nIn this section, the design with two built in interim analyses is discussed. Tables with required sample size for no or one interim analysis are provided in the appendix. All values are calculated with one-sided tests and using an un-pooled variance estimate. EAST software was used for sample size calculation [31].\nTable 2 shows the required sample size for design with two interim analyses. Ideally, improvement of 20% of response rate (justification can be found in the discussion) with 90% power is recommended. For 1:1 randomization, each arm requires 108 patients. In 1:2 randomization, the standard care arm requires 81 patients while the treatment arm requires 162 patients. Comparing this table with Tables 5 and 6 in the appendix, sample size did not increase much from those with no or one interim analysis. Therefore, two interim analyses are recommended since it does not require many additional patients. We suggest inflating the sample size from the table by approximately 5% to account for the loss of information (such as dropout after randomization).\n\nSince 1:2 randomization is recommended, we used the sample size value from Table 2 to compute toxicity boundaries (n = 81 and n = 162) at 25% toxicity level. A summarized toxicity boundary is presented in Table 3. In Table 3, if the overall number of subjects is 5 and out of 5 if there are 2 cases of toxicities, then the trial should stop because the toxicity boundary of 25% is exceeded. R computer program was used for toxicity boundary calculation [35]. The full toxicity boundaries can be found in Table 7 in appendix.\n\nFor patients in the high-risk group, sample size is calculated based on different levels of improvement rate at 90% and 80% power with two interim analyses (Table 4). P0 is the 30 days mortality rate in the standard arm and P1 is the 30 days mortality rate in the treatment arm. The sample size is the estimated number of subjects that are required to bring down the mortality rate from P0 to P1. Typically, we recommend a reduction in mortality from 70% to 55% with 90% power. In this case, 133 patients should be enrolled for the standard arm, and 266 should be enrolled for the treatment arm. When conducting two interim analyses, to start with, one should enroll 45 patients for the standard arm and 89 patients for the treatment arm, then perform the first look. Similar procedure should be used for the second and third look. For results with one interim analysis and 1:1 randomization, see Table 8 in the appendix. For results with one interim analysis and 1:2 randomization, see Table 9 in the appendix. For results with two interim analyses and 1:1 randomization, see Table 10 in the appendix. Note that all options have nearly identical required sample size, and therefore, performing two interim analyses would be more cost-effective from risk-benefit perspective such as the increased cost of recruiting additional patients. We suggest inflating the sample size by approximately 5% to account for the loss of information (such as dropout after randomization). As noted in the respective tables, which can be used for other effect sizes, much larger sample size is required if the effect size is smaller.\n\nDesigning a trial for testing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions for COVID-19 is challenging. The pandemic is new and there is little specific information about the virus and its adverse health effects. We do not yet clearly know the typical course of the infection, the range of susceptibility factors and the effects of co-morbid conditions. How the use of different medications, supplements and pharmaceuticals affect the severity of the infection also remain unknown. Whatever little information we currently have, is constantly being revised as new data become available. Nonetheless, it is important to develop streamlined clinical trial, designed with harmonized measures, questionnaires, biomarkers and clinical endpoints, so that the results of different trials could be compared. This is critically important in current circumstance, where a large number of clinical trials need to conducted, as rapidly as possible and with extraordinary care to ensure that maximal information could be extracted from each trial and the results obtained could be compared meaningfully with other trials in the field to administer effective therapies as soon as possible.\nMany factors need careful consideration in designing clinical trials, and critical decisions have to be made regarding which parameters to include and which tests should be conducted. In developing model clinical trial designs here, we gathered information from recently published manuscripts [4–8, 10], while fully recognizing that these may need revision. However, based on currently available evidence, we have developed robust design that may require only minimal modification and updating for rapid implementation.\nTo aid rapid and robust clinical evaluation, our trials have been designed for feasibility and for minimizing the number of participants required. Even though ideally, for a balanced design many known factors should be considered for stratification, we have selected only the most basic demographic parameters, as too many strata require much larger sample size. On the basis of currently available evidence, the stratification factors considered in our design seem most appropriate and generally-applicable to us; however, investigators should pick the factors that are most suitable for their patients and for the specific requirements of the trial. The stratification factors that we include in our design – age, sex and cardiovascular disease risk seem fundamental to the etiology of the infection, which seems primarily to affect older male individuals with pre-existing cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular disease risk [36].\nReasons for the high susceptibility of individuals with cardiovascular disease risk for COVID-19 remain unclear and are under intense investigation, but it has been speculated that conditions associated with chronic unresolved inflammation – such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, which are characterized by intrinsic immune dysfunction leading to inflammation may enhance the risk of severe infection and more severe outcomes [37]. Although there are significant racial and ethnic difference in susceptibility to cardiovascular disease [38, 39], there is little evidence to support racial differences per se and not race-specific differences in cardiovascular disease burden affect COVID-19 severity. However, should emerging data indicate that race is an important determinant of the severity of infection or its outcomes, independent of pre-existing cardiovascular disease risk, it could be used for additional stratification of the patient population. Additionally, if a trial is designed to assess pulmonary or renal outcomes, stratification based on lung or kidney function may be important. Note that it is important to consider stratification factors and balance the randomization so that tests for comparing the two groups would be unbiased.\nAs an alternative to stratified block randomization, one can use dynamic randomization [40]. In dynamic randomization, more stratification factors can be accommodated. For example, considering site as a stratification factor, assuming many sites are conducting study, the dynamic randomization can be useful. As a hypothetical example with 20 sites, sex, COVID-19 severity (at two level) and a co-morbidity (at two level) as stratification, a dynamic randomization can be used to minimize balance 1:1 allocation within each of 160 strata (20x2x2x2). However, a constant involvement of statistics team and implementation of the allocation approach make the process cumbersome. Also, when the treatment allocation is not equal (1:1), but different (such as 2:1), the probability calculation for allowable difference in allocation becomes much harder. To simplify, when there is frequent communication among sites, it is realistic to drop site as a stratification factor and use a stratified block randomization to implement 1:1 or 2:1 allocation. It is also easier to use a stratified z score to draw the inference.\nTable 11 in appendix provides critical values for decision making. The test statistic, Z, is based on the ratio of difference in estimated response rates and corresponding pooled standard error estimate. Because we are proposing a stratified randomized design, the test statistics needs to be estimated within each stratum and then pooled together. It may be noted that testing the equality of two response probabilities can be easily formulated in terms of testing the odds ratio. Then, one can obtain the stratified Z statistic, as described in Srivastava et al., and compare it to the cut-off provided in Table 11 in appendix to decide if the trial should be stopped at an interim analysis [26]. Adjusting for additional covariates or constructing confidence intervals for estimate of effect at interim analyses are not straightforward and requires additional considerations [30].\nIn the design of our clinical trials, we focused on primary outcomes. In general, mortality as the primary outcome seems appropriate at least for advanced stage patients, while for intermediate risk patients, looking at the proportion of patients discharged from hospital by the 15th day appears more appropriate. However, different primary endpoints may be considered, which along with appropriately selected secondary endpoints could provide important mechanistic information. Current evidence suggests that even though COVID-19 significantly impairs tissue function, much of the tissue injury is mediated by the resultant IL-6-driven cytokine storm that exacerbates pulmonary injury and may further damage other peripheral organs as has been reported for SARS [41–43]. Therefore, an intervention designed to decrease viral load, may be only marginally efficacious in preventing clinical symptoms, even though it might lead to a significant decrease in viral load, after the cytokine storm has already been initiated. Similarly, interventions targeted at pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., with antibodies) may not affect the viral load but significantly attenuate the subsequent response and clinical outcomes. Hence, to understand such non-linear relationships between infection and response, it may be important to judiciously select a panel of biomarkers informative of the immune response and its resolution at different stages of clinical disease progression.\nIn addition to monitoring biochemical, physiological and clinical responses, investigators should also be attentive to toxicity due to the therapeutic intervention per se. However, deciding upon an optimal toxicity monitoring rate is problematic, especially in a patient population with a high death rate, as is the case with advanced stage COVID-19 patients. A systematic toxicity monitoring rule is discussed, and its usage is suggested [44–47]. Usually Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) probability is assumed at 33% in Phase I cancer clinical trials, although a limit lower than 33% can be advocated. Yao et al. used a 21% toxicity rate in the previous trial and Ivanova et al. used a toxicity rate of 20% and 25% [48, 49]. Based on our 2-decades of experience in designing clinical trials, we suggest using a toxicity rate of 25%. The assumption here is that toxicities are manageable with some treatment if the patient is cured from COVID-19. Also, many of the drugs that are being evaluated in this population (such as Remdesvir) are already approved for another indication by FDA. Codes for calculating toxicity boundaries have been published before [50].\nWe have designed our clinical trials with the expectation that the treatment or intervention is likely to be more effective than standard care, hence all standard tests in the work were conducted one-sided. This could be readily ascertained during the interim analysis. Nevertheless, in some scenarios where the intervention is clearly not working or causing unacceptable toxicity, it may be appropriate to discontinue the trial and to test a different intervention. But usually this is difficult to establish, and therefore, care should be taken to continue the trial to its entirety, while monitoring closely to higher toxicity rates, particularly in intermediate stage patients.\nFor the intermediate-risk group, we suggest using a response rate of 20%. If it is desirable to have a lower response rate, for example, 10%, then the trial requires a much larger sample size (around 900 as shown in Table 2), and it is more likely to be a multicenter trial. However, it is usually not cost-effective to have such a large sample size to detect only 10% response rate. Nevertheless, we have provided sample size for different response rate in case someone is interested in conducting trials with response rates other than 20%. Note that when conducting a multicenter trial, no stratification should be conducted on centers.\nWe suggest inflating sample size very marginally (approximately 5%) from our calculation as normally an inflation of 10% to 20% is performed in regular clinical studies. The reason is that COVID-19 patients are unlikely to be lost in the follow up since could be a lethal disease, and enrolled patients in both the intermediate-risk group and high-risk group are likely to be quarantined in the hospital for an extended period of time. Therefore, we suggest inflation of the sample size by only 5% to account for unexpected events, such as suicide or patient dropout after randomization.\nFor the intermediate-risk patient group, we suggest using a composite endpoints design with two interim analyses and four factors stratification. The use of 1:2 randomization is recommended for broader patient benefit. Toxicity monitoring is acceptable at 25% level. For clinical trials with this patient population, we suggest that it is optimal to use 90% power and an improvement of 20% response rate (such as from 40% in the standard arm to 60% in the treatment arm).\nFor the high-risk patient group, we recommend a clinical trials design targeting the improvement of 30-day mortality with two interim analyses and three factors stratification. Given the precarious condition of patients in this group, no toxicity monitoring is needed. We suggest that for this group, the use of 1:2 randomization is ideal, and that a 15% reduction in the 30 day mortality rate (from 70% in the standard arm to 55% in the treatment arm) may be an optimal measure of acceptable efficacy.</br></br>","text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.HTML

Several options can be envisaged to control or prevent emerging infections of 2019-nCoV, including vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, oligonucleotide-based therapies, peptides, interferon therapies and small-molecule drugs. However, new interventions are likely to require months to years to develop. Given the urgency of the 2019-nCoV outbreak, we focus here on the potential to repurpose existing antiviral agents approved or in development for treating infections caused by HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and influenza1, based on therapeutic experience with two other infections caused by human coronaviruses: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).Virally targeted agents. Approved nucleoside analogues (favipiravir and ribavirin) and experimental nucleoside analogues (remdesivir and galidesivir) may have potential against 2019-nCoV. Nucleoside analogues in the form of adenine or guanine derivatives target the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and block viral RNA synthesis in a broad spectrum of RNA viruses, including human coronaviruses4. Favipiravir (T-705), a guanine analogue approved for influenza treatment, can effectively inhibit the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of RNA viruses such as influenza, Ebola, yellow fever, chikungunya, norovirus and enterovirus4, and a recent study reported its activity against 2019-nCoV (EC50 = 61.88 μM in Vero E6 cells)5. Patients with 2019-nCoV are being recruited in randomized trials to evaluate the efficacy of favipiravir plus interferon-α (ChiCTR2000029600) and favipiravir plus baloxavir marboxil (an approved influenza inhibitor targeting the cap-dependent endonuclease) (ChiCTR2000029544). Ribavirin is a guanine derivative approved for treating HCV and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) that has been evaluated in patients with SARS and MERS, but its side effects such as anaemia may be severe at high doses2 and whether it offers sufficient potency against 2019-nCoV is uncertain. Remdesivir (GS-5734) is a phosphoramidate prodrug of an adenine derivative with a chemical structure similar to that of tenofovir alafenamide, an approved HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitor. Remdesivir has broad-spectrum activities against RNA viruses such as MERS and SARS in cell cultures and animal models, and has been tested in a clinical trial for Ebola. A recent study reported that remdesivir inhibited 2019-nCoV (EC50 = 0.77 μM in Vero E6 cells)5, and a US patient with 2019-nCoV recovered after receiving intravenous remdesivir in January6. Two phase III trials were initiated in early February to evaluate intravenous remdesivir (200 mg on day 1 and 100 mg once daily for 9 days) in patients with 2019-nCoV (NCT04252664 and NCT04257656), with estimated completion dates in April 2020. Galidesivir (BCX4430), an adenosine analogue that was originally developed for HCV, is currently in early-stage clinical studies evaluating its safety in healthy subjects and its efficacy against yellow fever, and has shown antiviral activities in preclinical studies against many RNA viruses, including SARS and MERS2.\""],"execution_count":82,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"MRWSCvrhYweW"},"source":["spacy 모델을 로딩해주고"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"D7o4O3VIYvht","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1635248482200,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":8996,"user":{"displayName":"Jae-Mun Choi","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjEOc2rvasz74Lo3WDryVeTcNjhV80bSijN8EM1tw=s64","userId":"11322894783344015615"}}},"source":["nlp = en_ner_bc5cdr_md.load()\n","# nlp = spacy.load('../input/scispacy-model/en_ner_bc5cdr_md-0.2.4/en_ner_bc5cdr_md/en_ner_bc5cdr_md-0.2.4')"],"execution_count":83,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"g4FRbrxpY8o2"},"source":["예제 text를 처리해서 컬러로 하일라이팅 시켜보자.\n","spacy displacy는 자주 업데이트되기때문에 예제를 먼저 돌려서 점검해줌<br>\n","스타일 dep는 워드 토큰간의 dependency를 체크해줌"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":498},"id":"CyDwD4jMZGFO","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1635248933840,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":332,"user":{"displayName":"Jae-Mun Choi","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjEOc2rvasz74Lo3WDryVeTcNjhV80bSijN8EM1tw=s64","userId":"11322894783344015615"}},"outputId":"1bf7179f-5321-44ce-d29d-242294a35524"},"source":["doc = nlp(example_text)\n","colors = {\n","    'CHEMICAL': 'lightpink',\n","    'DISEASE': 'lightorange',\n","}\n","\n","# displacy.render(doc, style='dep', jupyter=True, options={\n","#     'colors': colors\n","# })\n","\n","displacy.render(doc, style='ent', jupyter=True, options={\n","    'colors': colors\n","})"],"execution_count":90,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<span class=\"tex2jax_ignore\"><div class=\"entities\" style=\"line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr\">Unfortunately, no drug or vaccine has yet been approved to treat human coronaviruses.

The study period was from April 1 to May 31, 2020.\n","The decision to implement the CDC guidelines for reuse/extended use of N95 masks was taken in April 2020 by the institute administration, and it was decided to issue a set of 5 N95 masks to all HCPs for a period of 20 d. Each mask was supplied in a paper envelope, which was used to store the mask following each use.\n","During the rollout, a multi-pronged approach was adopted for training the HCPs regarding reuse/extended use of these N95 masks; after the first cycle, feedback was sought from the HCPs regarding the most suitable method for spreading awareness regarding the appropriate use of these masks. A structured questionnaire was developed containing 17 questions. The questionnaire consisted of 4 sections. The first section contained 4 questions that had the demographic details of the participants. The second section contained 6 questions related to use of the N95 masks, the third section contained 3 questions related to the fit, and fourth section had 4 questions related to the overall satisfaction with the use of N95 masks. The questionnaire was bilingual (Hindi and English) and was created in both physical print form and an electronic version in Google forms. The questionnaire items were pooled and reviewed by a group of experts from different specialties. It was ensured that the items were free from any construction and semantic problems, grammatical errors, and it was ensured that it was easy to comprehend by varied strata of HCPs.\n","Sample size was calculated to be 1250 taking power as 80%, alpha 0.05, precision as 3%, nonresponse rate of 10% and prevalence as 50% (no previous similar study, so assumption). A list was obtained from the institute of all the health-care workers (HCWs). The sample was taken using random number table generated by computer. A link of the Questionnaire in Google Forms was circulated electronically to the members of the list through various channels, including groups on different social media platforms, using appropriate software, Facebook and WhatsApp applications. The physical questionnaire was distributed to the Sanitation Staff, Security Guards, Medical Records Staff, Stores Department, Engineering Maintenance Staff, Accounts Staff, and other administrative staff and was collected back after a week. Data were then transferred into Microsoft Excel 2016. Data cleaning was done in Microsoft Excel 2016. Analysis was done in Stata 11 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and have been presented as proportions while bivariable analysis between 2 categorical variables was done using chi-squared test, and P-value less than 0.05 was considered significant.\n","A total of 1121 responses were received during the data collection of the study at a response rate of 89.7%. Among the participants, 638 (56.9%) were male and 483 (43.1%) were female. The mean age of participants was 36.4 years.\n","The majority of the participants were Nursing Officers (29.4%), followed by Security personnel (27.6%). Responses were also received from Faculty, Resident Doctors, Administrative Nurses, General Administrative Officials, Technical Staff, and Sanitation and Housekeeping workers of the Institute.\n","A total of 911 (81.3%) participants stated that they had received the N95 masks for extended use along with brown covers. However, 200 (17.8%) received only the masks, while 8 (0.7%) claimed that they had not received the masks or their covers (Table 1).\n","\n","\n","\n","The decision to implement the CDC guidelines for reuse/extended use of N95 masks was taken by the Institute administration based on the recommendation of the Hospital Infection Control Committee in April 2020, and it was decided to issue a set of 5 N95 masks to all HCPs for a period of 20 d. Based on the guidelines, the masks were to be rotated daily and would be used for 5 cycles, each, at an interval of 4 d. The initial challenge was to educate the HCPs regarding appropriate use of these masks. During the rollout, a multi-pronged approach was adopted for training the HCPs regarding reuse/extended use of these N95 masks. An official circular was drafted and circulated throughout the institute as a hard copy as well as through email. The masks were distributed in brown envelopes, each of which contained 5 N95 masks and 4 small brown envelopes for storage. A bilingual video (Hindi & English) was also prepared and circulated on various social media platforms within the Institute.\n","Feedback was sought from the HCPs regarding the most suitable method for spreading awareness regarding the appropriate use of these masks. According to the participants, “pasting instructions on the brown paper covers” was the best method of passing information regarding the use of these masks. This was suggested by 482 (43%) of the participants. The other preferred methods suggested were circulation of hard copy of official order (25.5%) and circulation of video regarding use on social media (23.6%).\n","A total of 1082 (96.5%) participants used the set of N95 masks issued to them by the hospital. However, 17 (1.5%) used personally purchased N95 masks, while 22 (2%) stated that did not use any mask during the study period. Among the clinical staff, 2.69% did not use the N95 masks provided to them while among the nonclinical staff; only 0.20% did not use them. This difference was statistically significant with a P-value of 0.001.\n","The majority of the participants, 459 of 1121 (40.9%), responded that they used the masks for more than 15 d during the 20-d use cycle, while 269 (24%) had used them for 10-15 d, 177 (15.8%) for 5-10 d, and 216 (19.3%) for less than 5 d.\n","A total of 1038 (92.6%) participants used the masks during duty hours at the hospital. However, 483 (43.1%) used them during their travel to and from, 163 (14.5%) also used them during their visits to buy essential commodities, while 44 (3.9%) used them only while doing procedures on patients.\n","Most of the employees, 801 (71.5%), said that they used the masks for more than 6 h/d, while 226 (20.2%) used them for 4-6 h, 28 (2.5%) used the mask for less than 2 h (Table 2),\n","\n","\n","\n","The masks were a proper fit for 79.4% of the participants, while the rest stated that the masks did not fit them properly.\n","The most common problem stated with reuse of N95 masks was loss of fit followed by damage to the slings, doubt regarding the effectiveness and bad odor, highlighted by 44.6%, 44.4%, 41.6%, and 18.5% of the participants, respectively. Among the female participants, 22.62% stated that there was a problem of bad odor while among males 13.7% stated it as a problem. This difference was statistically significant with a P-value of 0.006.\n","A total of 476 (42.5%) participants responded that they would prefer “cup-shaped/fixed shape N95 masks with respirator,” if given a choice. The “duckbilled masks” were preferred by 24.5%, “masks with ear slings and respirator” was preferred by 18.8%, and “KN95 masks” by 12.1%.\n","The cup-shaped N95 masks with respirator were preferred by 45.54% of the males and 38.3% of the females, the ear-sling with respirator was preferred more among the females (22.98%) as compared to males (15.49%), the duck-billed were preferred by 20.5% of the females and 27.86% of the males. The difference in preference of masks among both the genders was statistically significant with a P-value of <0.001. There was also a difference in the preferred type of masks among the clinical and nonclinical staff. Among the clinical staff, the preferred type of mask was cup-shaped with respirator (40.81%), ear-sling with respirator (28.78%), duck-billed (16.59%), KN95 (10.24%), and 3-ply surgical masks (3.58%). The nonclinical staff preferred cup-shaped masks with respirator (44.38%) followed by duck-billed (34.52%), KN95 (14.20%), ear-sling with respirator (6.51%), and 3-ply surgical masks (0.34%). This difference in preference of masks among clinical and nonclinical staff was also significant with a P-value of <0.001 (Figure 1).\n","\n","\n","\n","The fourth section of the questionnaire required the participants to rate their satisfaction regarding various parameters on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being the least satisfactory and 5 being the most. The median scores regarding the satisfaction with the quality of masks and their fit was also 4 each.\n","The satisfaction regarding the quality was found to be significantly higher among the nonclinical staff (84.62%) as compared to the clinical staff (39.38%) and among males (65.05%) as compared to female participants (52.80%). The P-value for both was <0.001. The satisfaction regarding quality was higher among the participants who stated that they used the masks for a longer duration. Among the participants who used the masks for more than 6 h, 62.05% were satisfied with the quality while 48.39% participants who used the masks for less than 2 h were satisfied. The P-value was 0.014.\n","Similarly, the satisfaction regarding the fit was significantly higher among the nonclinical staff (85.6%) as compared to the clinical staff (41.98%). There was a statistically significant difference between the satisfaction level regarding the fit of the masks among male (66.46%) and female participants (55.28%); the P-value being <0.001. The satisfaction regarding fit was higher among the participants who stated that they used the masks for more than 6 h, 61.65% as compared to those who used it for lesser duration, 59.73% among those who used them for 4-6 h, 46.97% among those who used them for 2-4 h, and 54.84% for those who used the masks for less than 2 h. The P-value was 0.039 (Table 3).\n","\n","\n","\n","Because coronaviruses lose their viability significantly after 72 h, a rotation and re-use can be done assuming there is no soiling and minimal to no viral contamination of the mask.11 Studies suggest that the protection margin of limited reuse N95 masks begins to decrease after multiple donning, which varies with the ambient conditions and individual use. The type of N95 mask, ie, duck-billed or dome shape and its fit on the individual’s face also affected the duration of extended and limited use.12 Hence, it is preferable to limit the number of reuses to 5 to warrant an adequate safety margin.7 The CDC suggests that 5 masks to be acquired for 20 d and rotated daily, allowing them to dry for at least 72 h. In these interim periods, the masks are to be air dried by hanging or placement in individual, clean, breathable container like a paper bag.13,14\n","\n","In conclusion, the effectiveness of N95 masks depends on fit, level of exposures, and appropriate use. Moreover, the mask would only protect from oro-nasal aerosol contamination and not against contact transmission.15,16 Despite the above limitations, these reused masks provided better personal protection in comparison to cotton masks and homemade alternatives, such as handkerchiefs, or no protection at all.13 Still, extended use and re-use of single-use masks/respirators should only be considered in situations of critical shortage. Also, when practicing extended use or re-use, policies have to be fixed and individuals made aware of these guidelines.17 There is paucity in the literature of such clear and consistent guidelines, which warrants further attention. After due consideration of all the factors, the decision to provide N95 masks for extended use for all employees was taken, as was suggested by a 2400-bed hospital in Seoul that emphasized on respiratory protection to all patients and employees.18 In a communication by Jeon et al. on the experience of protection of HCWs against COVID-19 at a large teaching hospital in Seoul, there was evidence of marked reduction in risk to HCWs from category 3 (needing self-quarantine) to category 0 (usual management) with the use of 4 personal protective equipment (PPE) items, which included N95 respirators.18\n","\n","Patel et al. suggested that, during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, projecting the demand and supply of N95 respirators was a major challenge, because the pandemic as well as the supply chain were unpredictable.19,20 They also suggested that extended use or reuse of N95 masks was sometimes considered by HCWs to tide over the crisis.19,21 The institution anticipated the same challenges when it decided to implement extended use of N95 masks rather than using them for just 1 time.\n","Tan et al. studied the effect of extended use of N95 respirators on PPE use in COVID-19 outbreak wards of a Singapore hospital. After implementation of extended use, the average use of N95 respirators dropped down to 1710 from 2490.22,23 They further documented that, after nearly 45 d of implementation, there was no confirmed case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among the HCWs who had acquired the same from the hospital. The N95 masks were also found not to be contaminated after patient contact.22,24,25\n","\n","In 2020, Garcia Godoy et al. conducted a review regarding facial protection of HCWs during pandemics. They concluded that among HCWs, the rates of respiratory infections were less with use of N95 masks as compared to surgical masks.26-29 They also stated that extended use of N95 masks along with other infection control measures, such as hand hygiene poses minimal risk to the HCWs.23,26,30 The literature also suggests that continuous use of N95 masks was better as compared to sporadic use at the time of high-risk procedures,26,27 further strengthening our decision to provide N95 masks to all the employees.\n","Conservation, extended use, and reuse after decontamination have been described as PPE supply strategies in view of increased demand and failing supply line by Fillingham et al.30-34\n","\n","The most preferred method about disseminating information regarding the use of this mask was pasting instructions on the brown envelopes in which the masks were supplied.\n","The overall use of N95 masks provided for extended use was 96.5%, and most of the participants used these masks during their entire stay in the hospital. This is imperative for preventing the transmission of infection from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic HCPs to other providers and patients35 as the study by Hu et al. suggests that unprotected exposures are more likely from patients who did not have influenza-like symptoms.36,37 The nonuse of masks provided for extended use was more among the clinical staff as compared to the nonclinical staff. This might be due to the fact that the clinical staff has access to other sources of masks, such as inpatient areas, outpatient departments, and/or procedure rooms, where separate masks were provided for front-line HCWs.\n","The 5 masks were provided for use during a 20-d cycle, after which they would again be reissued. Although the majority of the participants were satisfied with the quality and fit of the masks, 60% of them did not use it for more than 15 d. Another probable reason for this could be a problem with the N95 masks, which were loss of fit and damage to the slings, as highlighted by 44.6% and 44.4% of the participants, respectively. Also, it was observed that most of the participants used these masks for more than 6 h/d, which was probably because they used them during the duty hours (92.6%) and the shift are usually 8 h long.\n","In our study, the participants stated that they preferred the cup-shaped mask the most, followed by the duck-billed ones, and lastly the N95 masks and KN95 masks. The literature suggests that the cup-shaped and duck-billed masks are easy to don and doff and are more comfortable as compared to particulate respirators (N95, KN95, FFP2, FFP3, etc.)38-40 Also, in our study, surgical masks were considered to provide adequate protection against COVID-19 only by 3.58% of the clinical staff and 0.3% of the nonclinical staff. This finding is consistent with the findings of the study conducted by Hu et al. among HCWs in 21 ICUs in China during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, where it was revealed that 33.1% of the respondents believed that surgical masks provide adequate protection as opposed to 88.3% who believed N95 masks to be adequate.36\n","\n","The satisfaction regarding the quality and fit of N95 masks was higher among the nonclinical staff as compared to the clinical staff as the latter has to use the masks continuously for a longer duration as they worked in high-intensity patient care areas. Another reason for dissatisfaction among the clinical staff could be that they had the option to use other types of N95 masks supplied to the clinical area, which were single-use ones. The participants who stated that they used the masks for a longer duration were more satisfied with the quality and fit of the masks, thus reinforcing that good quality and fit is necessary for better compliance.\n","A study conducted by Scarano et al. regarding the effects of protective face masks on skin temperature and comfort revealed that use of N95 masks was associated with raised skin temperature in the facial region leading to greater discomfort as compared to surgical masks.41 Another study by Hua et al. on short-term effects of use of N95 masks, states that skin reaction were more common with N95 masks as compared to surgical masks.42 However, these studies were conducted on subjects in nonclinical setting where the fear of transmission of infection is eliminated. However, in our study, the participants were involved in thecare of suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients and probably the prevention of transmission was a priority over the discomfort associated with use of N95 masks. The result of our study can be interpreted accordingly.\n","In a study by Rebmann et al. on effects and compliance of N95 mask use among Nursing staff of ICUs, it was concluded that there was no clinically significant physiological burden for health-care personnel apart from certain subjective symptoms, and the compliance was fairly high, despite the discomfort and repeated readjustments, which increased over time.43 In our study, compliance and satisfaction were found to be high as the survey was conducted during early phases of the pandemic when the fear among general population and the health-care personnel was high.\n","The limitation of the study was that the survey was carried out through a structured questionnaire, which may have tempted the participants to answer the most acceptable response rather than what is their true perception, and it was carried out in a very short period of time, as the future course of action regarding the supply of these masks had to be decided.\n","It was concluded that the extended use of N95 masks was acceptable, with more than 96% of the participants using these masks. Most of them used the masks during their duty hours (92.6%) and the duration of use was more than 6 h for 71.5% of the participants. Out of the stipulated 20-d period during each cycle, the masks were used for more than 15 d by majority of the respondents (40.9%). According to the participants, the best method to disseminate information regarding the extended use of these masks was by pasting instructions on the brown envelope. The authors used a multi-pronged approach for passing on information to the users. The majority of the participants preferred the cup-shaped/fixed-shape N95 masks with front valve over other types of masks. The maximum participants rated their satisfaction with the fit and quality of N95 masks as 4 on a scale of 1 to 5. The participants who were more satisfied used the masks for longer duration.\n","Because the majority of participants were satisfied with the extended use of N95 masks, there are definite advantages, not only in financial terms but also to preserve a precious and scarce resource at the time when the demand outnumbers the supply. However, it is recommended to study the effect of extended use of N95 masks on the risk of transmission of respiratory infections to HCPs.\n","\n"," -------------------------------------------------- \n","\n","TITLE: Gasification of refuse-derived fuel from municipal solid waste for energy production: a review\n","\n","\n","Continuous supply of energy and proper waste disposal has always been the global challenges that require continual research and development. Proper waste disposal and the security of public wellbeing should be strengthened and combined when supporting circular economic values (Pio et al. 2020). However, the global energy supply primarily focuses on dwindling fossil fuel resulting in its over-exploitation and utilization, leading to detrimental effect to the environment for instance, production of greenhouse gases in the form of CO2 and N2O. In fact, according to the Environmental Protection Agency of United State, the emission of CO2 and N2O that resulted from the combustion of fossil fuel had achieved approximately 4300 million metric tonnes and 57 million metric tonnes in 2018, respectively. Moreover, increased human reproduction frequency, upgraded living quality, and extensive industrialization have indisputably increased the generated waste volume and demand of energy.\n","Municipal solid waste, also generally termed trash or garbage, represents a non-hazardous unwanted item that is constantly supplied by human. Since the past few decades until present, the disposal of municipal solid waste has always been a demanding challenge due to ever-expanding human population. In addition, due to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 followed by the emergency lockdown and stay at home policy enforced in most of the countries, the unprecedented increase in municipal solid waste generated such as increasing use of plastic packaging with approximately more than 6000 tonnes per day in the Southeast Asian countries (Haque et al. 2020) could be even more challenging especially to those countries with unsatisfactory municipal solid waste management (Sarkodie and Owusu 2020). It was forecasted that the production of municipal solid waste will achieve 1.42 kg/capita/day by the year 2025 (Hoornweg and Bhada-Tata 2012) and will likely hit 2.6 billion metric tonnes in 2030 (Statista 2020). Figure 1 illustrates the volume of municipal solid waste generated across the globe (Statista 2018). Improper open dumping of municipal solid waste is still being carried out despite its widely reported adverse and long-lasting effects to the human health and environment such as air and water pollution (Cremiato et al. 2018; Fan et al. 2018; Malav et al. 2020). Therefore, there is an urgent need to research on more environmentally friendly and practical technology to divert municipal solid waste from open dumping.\n","Municipal solid waste can be segregated into combustible substance, non-combustible substance, and material with high moisture according to Caputo and Pelagagge (2002). The combustible substance which is also known as refuse-derived fuel composes mainly of carbon-based derivatives such as organics, plastic, paper, wood, and textile. The plastic and paper consist of 50–80% are the major fractions composed in refuse-derived fuel, while the remaining fractions are contributed by organics, wood, and textile (Casado et al. 2016; Fyffe et al. 2016). Figure 2 illustrates the compositions of municipal solid waste. Hence, the refuse-derived fuel fraction in municipal solid waste can be potentially used as another source of energy since it contains around 18 MJ/kg of calorific value which is comparable with soon-to be-depleted fossil fuel in less than 50 years from now (Porshnov et al. 2018; Shahbaz et al. 2016). Utilization of refuse-derived fuel as one of the energy sources is also well-aligned with the 7th sustainable development goal: affordable and clean energy (Dada and Mbohwa 2018). Figure 3 outlines the conversion process of municipal solid waste into refuse-derived fuel.\n","Waste-to-energy represents a viable solution that gains significant interest and attraction in the world due to its ability to provide simultaneous waste disposal and environmental protection (Ramos et al. 2018). Waste-to-energy can be realized via gasification, pyrolysis, and combustion (Gunarathne et al. 2019; Nanda and Berruti 2020a). Commercial plants of pyrolysis and combustion for waste-to-energy are available at industrial scale (Foong et al. 2020c; Pio et al. 2020), while gasification plant is comparatively limited. Despite that these technologies are commercially available, the research work on optimization and exploration of its further potential is still undergoing vigorously (Ge et al. 2020, 2021; Gutiérrez et al. 2020; Hameed et al. 2021; Liew et al. 2018b; Ma et al. 2019; Pedrazzi et al. 2019). Among these, gasification is getting increasing attention due to its capability in producing higher yield of cleaner gaseous fuel such as hydrogen and syngas than combustion and pyrolysis (Jiang et al. 2019).\n","In light of the above-mentioned studies, this review highlights the recent progress in gasification of refuse-derived fuel for energy production and its existing research gaps to be filled in by future research. This review covers the existing efforts of refuse-derived fuel production in several countries, recent progress of refuse-derived fuel gasification for energy production, modelling of gasification, economic assessment along with future challenge and prospects of this technology.\n","The development of renewable energy has been a continuous effort in the USA since the enforcement of American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009. More than ten waste-to-energy facilities were built for the processing of municipal solid waste to obtain refuse-derived fuel as boiler fuel. In fact, these facilities pursue fairly comprehensive processing of municipal solid waste and obtain fuel of better quality compared with direct energy extraction from municipal solid waste in other waste-to-energy facilities. Figure 4 illustrates the amount of energy recovered from municipal solid waste in different countries. In addition to achieving their ambitious target to fulfil one-tenth of the electricity demand via renewable energy (Adaramola et al. 2017), the municipal solid waste that is commonly predestined for pilling up at the landfill sites would be diverted as feedstock for refuse-derived fuel production. As a result, the demand for refuse-derived fuel is estimated to significantly increase to, for instance, approximately 115 million tonnes if it is intended to substitute 5% of the coal usage for electricity generation (Gershma 2010).\n","Refuse-derived fuel has been progressively recognized as an alternative renewable energy in the UK. In fact, production of refuse-derived fuel in the waste-to- energy facilities has contributed up to 50% reduction of municipal solid waste being sent to the landfill in the past decade (Brew 2018). In general, most of the refuse-derived fuel producers focus on “one-time pass” processing technologies to produce refuse-derived fuel that can be used directly as fuel without further treatment to minimize the start-up capital, processing cost, and maintenance frequency. The refuse-derived fuel obtained is commonly used as coal substitute in cement industry to reduce 40% emission of CO2 (Rodrigues and Joekes 2011). Nevertheless, vigorous efforts have been invested on researching innovative technologies and improving the existing technologies to realize better fuel quality and larger profit margin. In short, production of refuse-derived fuel is expected to impart with revolutionized role in the renewable energy sector of the UK.\n","Other than developed countries, the interest on recovery of refuse-derived fuel from municipal solid waste has also been extended to a few developing countries such as Indonesia, India, and Thailand. Indonesia is identified as one of the countries in the world with the highest growth of population, estimated to hit 270 million people that would produce 150,000 ton/day of municipal solid waste by 2025 (Kubota and Ishigaki 2018). Efforts have been undertaken by their government on the management of municipal solid waste by putting high hope in the conversion of this waste into refuse-derived fuel as a replacement for coal. This includes publishing guidelines to highlight the proposed facility design for the processing of refuse-derived fuel with optimum quality, the regulation of feed-in-tariffs for refuse-derived fuel processing facility, and more stringent municipal solid waste management law. Similar efforts were also performed by the government in India and Thailand where waste management and energy-related policies have been enforced to promote the transformation of municipal solid waste into refuse-derived fuel as coal substitute (Pandey et al. 2019; Srisaeng et al. 2017).\n","South Africa is heavily dependent on coal usage to satisfy more than 75% energy demand by the nation (Joshua and Bekun 2020). This no doubt puts South Africa into the dilemma of energy security and environmental issues simultaneously. Therefore, to tackle these crises, the government launched carbon tax in 2019 with the aim to reduce the carbon emission resulting from industries, mainly power production plants (Slater 2020), while also slowly diverting the utilization of fossil fuel to renewable energy. In addition, the government offers carbon tax discount to those companies contributing to the growth of renewable energy development and application. This in turn stimulates the progress in production of refuse-derived fuel from municipal solid waste which becomes increasingly attractive within the country (Slater 2020).\n","Refuse-derived fuel is also getting attention in middle east countries. The exploration of refuse-derived fuel from municipal solid waste as potential renewable energy has been triggered in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia despite this country represents the second-largest producer of petroleum in the world (Investopedia 2020). The energy demand in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is increasing and estimated to achieve more than 100 GW by 2032 (Ouda et al. 2017). Therefore, the government is now making efforts to explore the potential of renewable energy with the aim to fulfill 60% of the energy demand prior to reducing the dependence on petroleum (Nizami et al. 2015; Ouda et al. 2016). In the United Arab Emirates, their progress on refuse-derived fuel production is one step ahead compared to Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The first refuse-derived fuel production plant resulted from the collaboration between the government and a local company was launched on October 2020 to transform up to 80% of the municipal solid waste into refuse-derived fuel. Similar to other countries, the quality of the refuse-derived fuel makes it as a coal substitute for use in cement industry (Clarke 2020).\n","The application of refuse-derived fuel as a multipronged solution to dwindling fossil fuel energy, sustainable municipal solid waste management, and increased energy demand is gaining attraction throughout the globe. As nations are moving towards addressing climate change issues such as greenhouse gas emissions by signing onto global agreements such as Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement. The prospect of municipal solid waste as a potential source of energy will be supported by various countries and application of refuse-derived fuel as feedstock will be an attractive investment.\n","Gasification represents a thermal-induced chemical reaction in which the organic fraction of the material is extensively oxidized at high temperature with more than 1500 °C in the presence of finite oxygen, air, CO2, or H2O/steam (Lam et al. 2016). This process generally yields syngas comprises of CO plus H2 as gaseous fuel associated with minor fractions of CH4 and CO2 (Foong et al. 2020a, 2020c). The main reactions occur during gasification are usually exothermic as shown in Table 1. Gasification also shows high flexibility in feedstock variation (Saidi et al. 2020). The common feedstock for gasification includes biomass (Putro et al. 2020; Sittisun et al. 2019), coal (Grabowski et al. 2020), carbonized products (Chen et al. 2019; He et al. 2019), plastics (Nanda and Berruti 2020b), and municipal solid waste (Martínez et al. 2020).\n","In 1975, the first resource recovery plant was established in Iowa, the USA, that converts municipal solid waste into refuse-derived fuel for energy production in local power plant (Sequeira 2019). The research interest on refuse-derived fuel gasification for energy recovery continually increases since then (Achinas and Kapetanios 2013; Corella et al. 2008; Galvagno et al. 2006; Morris and Waldheim 1998). Dalai et al. (2009) conducted gasification of refuse-derived fuel using steam as a gasifying agent to produce syngas. The selectivity and energy value of the resulted syngas were found to be influenced significantly by the ratio of steam to refuse-derived fuel and temperature. Chiemchaisri et al. (2010) converted refuse-derived fuel mainly into gaseous fuel in a small-scale downdraft gasified with air as gasifying agent. Other than investigations on the influence of process parameters, the production cost of energy via refuse-derived fuel gasification was also estimated to be USD 0.05/kWh.\n","However, the problematic tar compound that characterized as black–brown viscous liquid generated in the refuse-derived fuel gasification usually creates troubles where the tar could adhere strongly on the surface of the machinery parts that would lead to process malfunctioning (Singh et al. 2014). In addition, other problems such as production of unwanted dark residues and discharge of NOx, hydrogen sulphide, and SOx were also observed when gasification was performed on plastic wastes and coal, respectively (Shahbaz et al. 2020). Hence, in the past decade, the research focus has been directed towards the co-gasification of refuse-derived fuel with biomass. The co-gasification process is deemed to be more beneficial over conventional refuse-derived fuel gasification process in terms of minimum tar formation, improved process efficiency, and exploration on the synergistic effects between refuse-derived fuel and biomass with different compositions (Masnadi et al. 2015b).\n","Cai et al. (2021) performed co-gasification of refuse-derived fuel and straw mixtures adopting a laboratory scale of fixed-bed reactor under the temperature ranging from 600–900 °C. The results were compared with gasification of single feedstock to examine the synergistic effects of the co-gasification process. The author revealed that co-gasification showed improved yield on gaseous products, better efficiency of cold gas, and carbon conversion than normal gasification. Similar findings were also reported by Burra and Gupta (2018) in co-gasification of refuse-derived fuel and wood pellet. Furthermore, the addition of straw mixture could have concealed the melting agglomeration of inorganic content that usually forms sticky ash due to the presence of calcium, aluminosilicate, and carbonates (Cprek et al. 2007; Smidt et al. 2010) at the reactor bottom when only refuse-derived fuel is gasified.\n","Aside from the research at laboratory scale, the co-gasification has also been advanced to pilot scale (Pio et al. 2017, 2020). The co-gasification of refuse-derived fuel and pine biomass was conducted in a 80 kWth bubbling fluidized bed reactor associated with the assessment of several parameters such as lower heating value of producer gas, efficiency of cold gas, and carbon conversion. Again, the synergistic effect shown by the co-gasification of refuse-derived fuel and pine biomass was obvious compared with gasification of only pine biomass. The authors found that the co-gasification had improved the yield of methane and ethylene up to 78.2% in the gaseous products, as a result the overall lower heating value was enhanced from 5.8 to 6.4 MJ/Nm3. In addition, the co-gasification had also prevented the issue of defluidization and formation of slag (Pio et al. 2020). The undeniable advantages are clearly indicated by co-gasification of refuse-derived fuel and biomass in terms of product quality and process maintenance as compared with gasification of single feedstock.\n","Other than biomass, the refuse-derived fuel was also co-gasified with the biochar to produce 55.8 vol% of H2 in syngas compared to co-gasification with biomass that yielded a lower H2 of 45.2 vol% (Zaini et al. 2020). Considering that the majority of volatiles matters have been expelled from the resulted biochar after thermochemical transformation, the formation of tar could be averted when the biochar is gasified (Jia et al. 2017). Similar finding was obtained by Zaini et al. (2020) where co-gasification of refuse-derived fuel with biochar had reduced 72% of tar yield compared to co-gasification of refuse-derived fuel and biomass. The reduction of tar could be due to the tar reforming reaction occurred on the surface of biochar that involve dehydrogenation, tar adsorption, and gasification (Shen and Fu 2018). On top of that, the alkali and alkaline earth metals (AAEM) such as potassium, calcium, and magnesium that inherently present in the biochar could also serve as catalytic active sites to induce tar reforming reaction (Feng et al. 2017; Lam et al. 2015). In addition, the AAEM present as ash in refuse-derived fuel was also reported to enhance the production of light hydrocarbons (Masnadi et al. 2015c). Figure 5 shows the transformation route of municipal solid waste to gaseous fuel. Table 2 shows the existing efforts on co-gasification of different wastes.\n","Numerical models have been established to estimate the optimum process parameters and outcome since trial and error will be cost-ineffective and time-intensive. (Couto et al. 2015). In tandem with advances in programming associated with high technology computational hardware, complicated numerical simulations and sophisticated calculations are easily realized over the last decades. Despite that many papers have been published on the modelling of biomass gasification (Aravind et al. 2012; Cao et al. 2020; Das et al. 2020; Rahma et al. 2021; Vecchione et al. 2015) and refuse-derived fuel gasification (Barba et al. 2011; Kardaś et al. 2018; Násner et al. 2017), concerted efforts are still required to contribute new findings to the existing database since there are countless types of biomass with different chemical compositions to enhance the accuracy of modelling.\n","On the other hands, limited modelling work has been reported on the co-gasification especially that involving refuse-derived fuel where the only study was found as reported by Kardaś et al. (2018) for the co-gasification of beechwood and refuse-derived fuel that adopted a stationary two-fluid model to describe both solid and gas phases. A polynomial model was recently reported for the co-gasification of sugarcane bagasse with municipal solid waste adopting a steady state and one-dimensional approach using MATLAB software to describe the process outcome including heating value, composition of syngas, and energy efficiency (Lewin et al. 2020). The impact of several process parameters was then determined and optimized using central composite design. The models developed showed high accuracy as determined by its high R2 values and verified via the literature for validation (Yucel and Hastaoglu 2016). The author concluded that the model developed with smooth functioning revealed promising exploration for co-gasification of biomass and municipal solid waste, hence providing motivation for future study to be conducted on other feedstocks.\n","Instead of comparing with existing studies, some of the studies reported to verify their models with real experimentation. Xu (2013) employed MATLAB for development of two phases flow model in the co-gasification of biomass with coal pellets. The models were obtained using data produced from the co-gasification experiment at bench scale which was then verified with the real data produced from a pilot-scale experiment. Jeong et al. (2017) performed a modelling study on co-gasification of wood pellet and Douglas coal using computational fluid dynamics, and then, the findings were also verified and corroborated with the real data obtained from the operating gasification plant in Spain, thus indicating the reliable accuracy of the modelling results. Despite that the research on modelling studies of co-gasification is making good progress (Ali et al. 2017; Hantoko et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2020), huge research gap is awaiting to be filled by more studies performed with different combinations of feedstock and inclusion of underexplored material such as refuse-derived fuel.\n","Economic analysis is an important aspect to determine the feasibility of a technology for commercialization. Although gasification plant has been existing for waste treatment (San Miguel et al. 2012), the economic analysis is still performed and reported in some recent studies to further explore its potential for commercialization with optimum benefit (Salkuyeh et al. 2018; Thunman et al. 2019). Luz et al. (2015) present the economic feasibility of municipal solid waste gasification involving the estimation of costs for commercialization and potential revenues. The estimation of commercialization cost covers process operation and maintenance, installation, and design of equipment, associated with the interest rate of the investment. For the estimation of potential revenues, the income from electricity sale and recyclable materials including glasses, metals, and plastics, the profit of gasification by-product such as char, and stipend paid by the local government in Brazil for the demolition of municipal solid waste were considered. The economic feasibility was assessed under equipment lifetime of 20 years via two economic indicators which are internal rate of return and net present value. It was revealed that the larger capacity of the installation will gain more benefits at lower costs, thus more economic feasible. It was anticipated by the author that the financial support from the Brazilian municipalities is essential to realize the commercialization, otherwise the overall profit might not convince the investors. On the other hands, a straightforward cost estimation considered only the materials and energy required in post-treatment was reported by Goswami et al. (2019) on the product of biochar obtained from gasification instead of the technology used. Despite that the estimated cost of 1.89 USD/kg was comparatively lower than the average cost at 2.85 USD/kg according to the International of Biochar Initiative, the value obtained will be different when other expenses such as equipment capital, process operation and maintenance are included, thus suggesting that the economic analysis would be useful and representable only if complete costing details are taken into consideration.\n","Economic analysis was also reported in co-gasification study (Carvalho et al. 2018; Jia et al. 2018). A thorough cost–benefit analysis was reported by Ng et al. (2017) using Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the profit feasibility of implementing a co-gasification plant in chicken farm. The cost analysis included an initial investment on land and equipment required, materials, process operation and maintenance, uncertainties occurred at present and future, and potential damage caused during the process (You et al. 2016). The benefit analysis mainly constituted of the income from energy via electricity sale, by-product such as biochar, and disposal of chicken manure. The authors estimated the standard deviation of net present value distribution to be about 22 million USD over 20 years. They also concluded that there was about 42% of chances to generate profit for the farm via the proposed co-gasification system. Interestingly, the chances could be increased to over 90% if either the price of feedstock is discounted by half, or the price of electricity or biochar is doubled. In fact, the price of biochar could be varied according to its used in different applications such as heterogeneous catalysis (Balajii and Niju 2019; Foong et al. 2020b), agriculture (Lam et al. 2019; Wan Mahari et al. 2020), wastewater remediation (Cai et al. 2020; Klasson et al. 2013), aquaponics (Su et al. 2020), and synthesis of activated carbon (Heidarinejad et al. 2020; Liew et al. 2018a).\n","The future of refuse-derived fuel application at global scale seems to be a promising prospect considering the accuracy and reliability of modelling design and real-time experimental/industrial output which is further supplemented by the urgency in solving one of mankind’s impending environmental crisis. However, there are several challenges that need to be tackled to ensure proper and equitable adoption of this technology worldwide. Currently, the development of refuse-derived fuel facilities is concentrated in major countries such as the USA, Europe, China, Japan, and India. The economic and social transformation occurring at other nations also brought about increased municipal solid waste issues to respective nations. For instance, Sub-Saharan Africa nations have both the need for cements and rapidly increasing municipal solid waste output volume which prompted interest in studying the benefits of refuse-derived fuel facilities being established (Larionov and Demir Duru 2017). Sub-Saharan Africa nations are projected to achieve substantially higher population count compared to the rest of the world which places them in a unique position to fully take advantage of establishing refuse-derived fuel facilities to solve the upcoming municipal solid waste management nightmare. Furthermore, development of refuse-derived fuel technology and subsequent commercialization of said technology plays a crucial role in establishing concept of circular economy in the aspects of waste management. Circular economy is defined as transformation of goods with completed service life into resources for reuse thus closing loop in industrial ecosystems while minimizing waste (Stahel 2016). As such, development of refuse-derived fuel facilities in developed and developing nations and between urban and rural regions poses unique set of challenges.\n","\n","Figure 6 Future of refuse-derived fuel. In order to realize the promising future of refuse-derived fuel, further research work should include investigations on more process parameters and co-gasification with different types of feedstock. Then, optimization study using modelling software, life cycle assessment, and circular economy is inevitable. Finally, sufficient funding is required for commercialization. \n","Entry barrier for establishing refuse-derived fuel facilities in developing countries tends to be higher due to lack of investment funding available, proper municipal solid waste management by consolidation or privatization, lacking or non-existent government policies, and lack of public awareness. As such governments of these nations need to proactively formulate necessary policies and induce public awareness while directing required investment funds to establish refuse-derived fuel facilities. However, the stakeholders of municipal solid waste and refuse-derived fuel technology need to engage properly to avoid being left out as the technology rapidly evolves. In most low- and middle-income countries, existence of informal waste sector can be a challenge in streamlining municipal solid waste management as it represents as source of income to significant part of the population (Aparcana 2017; Sandhu et al. 2017).\n","Meanwhile, the difference in population size between urban and rural region has its own set of prospects and challenges. Urban regions with high population tend to have higher amount of municipal solid waste generated where the prospect of developing refuse-derived fuel facilities is brighter for both government and private sector compared to rural regions. However, changes in municipal solid waste management and high-level investment needed could pose a challenge. Lack of sizeable population in rural area meanwhile could not attract refuse-derived fuel facilities development for factors including low amount of generated waste to be supplied as feedstock. In order to develop refuse-derived fuel facilities in regions with different demands and conditions, experimental designs together with modelling works will play a crucial role. Development of refuse-derived fuel including gasification technology can pave way to reach a goal where municipal solid waste will no longer be viewed as waste material but instead as energy source that is sustainable. In regard to co-gasification, more research especially in modelling aspect is needed to advocate refuse-derived fuel co-gasification with other materials to sufficiently prove the benefits in order to attract government and private investments. Furthermore, life cycle assessment of refuse-derived fuel feedstock application in waste-to- energy conversion is necessary to substantiate the sustainability and environmentally friendly nature of this energy production. Currently life cycle assessment of energy produced from refuse-derived fuel feedstock is scarcely studied especially co-gasification which is needed to gain an edge for commercialization efforts.\n","\n"," -------------------------------------------------- \n","\n","TITLE: COVID-IRS: A novel predictive score for risk of invasive mechanical ventilation in patients with COVID-19\n","\n","\n","To develop a new severity score for the prediction of IMV in COVID-19.\n","We retrospectively collected information from all COVID-19 patients aged 18 years or older admitted to the American British Cowdray Medical Center, a private teaching hospital in Mexico City, between March 12 and August 10, 2020. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was suspected based on clinical manifestations and confirmed by means of a positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2, which was carried out according to the Centers for Disease Control published guidelines [8] or in case of a negative PCR, with a chest CT scan with characteristic findings for COVID-19. The primary outcome was the need for IMV.\n","Exclusion criteria included having a “Do Not Resuscitate” order or having incomplete data in the electronical medical record. The ethics committee waived the requirement for an informed consent. All the analyzed data was fully anonymized from the moment it was captured and remained so during the entire duration of the study. The protocol (ID: ABC-20-50) was approved by our local scientific and ethics committees (Comité de Ética en Investigación, American British Cowdray Medical Center) and conducted according to the principles of the Helsinki declaration.\n","We divided the cohort in two groups of roughly equal size using a random number generation algorithm. The larger group was used for the development cohort, while the smaller group was used as the validation cohort. We compared both cohorts using the chi-square test for categorical variables and Man-Whitney U test for continuous variables, in order to find significant differences in their baseline characteristics and outcomes.\n","We categorized patients’ characteristics at hospital admission into the following groups of variables: demographic and anthropometric characteristics, clinical features, medical history, laboratory results, and clinical outcomes. Demographic and anthropometric characteristics included age, gender, body mass index, and ethnicity. Clinical features included vital signs, presence of symptoms characteristic of COVID-19 (dyspnea, fever, cough, etc.), and date of symptom onset. Medical history included currently diagnosed comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, cancer, etc.), smoking status, alcohol consumption, and current medical treatments. Laboratory results included complete blood count (CBC), coagulation tests, blood chemistry panel, liver function tests, lipid profile, inflammatory markers, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), ultrasensitive C reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, fibrinogen and procalcitonin, as well as and 25-hydroxi-vitamin D3. Clinical outcomes included in-hospital death, length of stay and the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV).\n","Using the development cohort, we performed univariate logistic regressions for IMV using all the variables mentioned above. We selected all variables that had a p value <0.1 and conducted a backwards stepwise multivariate logistic regression to find the variables that were independently associated with the requirement of IMV. After the selection of the optimal variables for the model, in order to ensure the model’s applicability in most settings, we checked for the laboratory variable’s availability in general settings. This was done via a telephonic interview on 7 different general hospitals in Mexico City and its surroundings. The variables that were not available in more than 50% of the screened hospitals were deemed to be not readily available. We tested for similar variables using the Spearman correlation test in order to identify suitable surrogates. Thus, we developed two predictive models, one constructed with optimal variables and the other one with accessible surrogate variables.\n","After identifying the predictive variables, we carried out locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) curves on numerical variables in order to determine adequate intervals and cut-off points on both models. Subsequently, in order to assign a scoring value to the selected variables, we estimated their coefficient of variation using univariate logistic regressions and assigned the rounded-up coefficient as the numeric value for the score in the corresponding strata. We constructed receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves in order to evaluate the performance of our scores. Evaluation for goodness of fit was carried out by means of the Hosmer-Lemeshow test and predictive performance was ascertained by the concordance index (C-index). We evaluated internal calibration with 2000 bootstrap samples. The score underwent external validation by comparing the ROC curves of the development and validation cohorts. Finally, we compared the ROC curves of our score with the calculated ROC curves of other scores that predict ventilatory deterioration or other adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients (ABC-GOALScl, COVID-GRAM, NEWS-2, CURB-65, and CALL prediction model) [9–13] in both, the development and validation cohorts. We compared the ROC curves of the aforementioned scores using only the data from those patients in whom all the scores were calculated appropriately. We performed all statistical analyses using STATA version 14 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA) and GraphPad Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).\n","S2 Table (S2 Table. Univariate logistic regressions for variable selection) depicts the univariate logistic regressions for all individual variables. Based on the backwards stepwise multivariate logistic regression (S3 Table. Multivariate logistic regression), we selected the following predictive variables for the development of the score: Respiratory rate, SpO2/FiO2 ratio, LDH and IL-6. Since IL-6 was deemed as not readily available in most settings, we decided to use the Neutrophil/Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) as a suitable surrogate, due to its easy availability and good performance in both, the correlation test (Spearman’s rho = 0.485, p<0.001) and the multivariate logistic model (coefficient 0.049, p = 0.004, R-squared = 0.3428) (Fig 1) (S4 Table. Spearman’s correlation results and R-squared of multivariate logistic regression models for surrogate variables).\n","We named our score COVID-IRS (Intubation Risk Score). We constructed two different versions of the score: COVID-IRS-IL6 using the optimal model and COVID-IRS-NLR using the accessible variables. We further stratified the aforementioned scores into low, moderate, high, and very high-risk categories. The scores and their respective interpretations are shown in Fig 2. Although there was a tendency towards a higher median amount of days between patient admission to the hospital and the requirement of IMV in lower risk groups (ex. 5 days in low risk patients vs. one day in high risk patients) these differences did not prove to be statistically significant (COVID-IRS-NLR, p = 0.371; COVID-IRS-IL6, p = 0.275) (S1 Fig. Median days from patient admission until IMV requirement by risk group).\n","Fig 3 shows the ROC curves for both scores in the development and validation cohorts. The area under the curve (AUC) in the development cohort was 0.877 (0.823–0.931) using the NLR based score and 0.891 (0.843–0.939) using the IL-6 based score. Internal validation was excellent, with the goodness-of-fit tests being statistically significant (NLR: p = 0.179; IL-6 p = 0.189), as well as the bootstrap replications (NLR: p<0.001; IL-6 p<0.001). The AUC in the validation cohort was smaller than the one in the development cohort, with 0.823 (0.758–0.887) using the NLR based score and 0.826 (0.759–0.892) using the IL-6 based score. A good correlation was found between predicted and measured risks (S2 Fig. Predicted and observed percentages of patients who required IMV at each point of both COVID-IRS scores in the development and validation cohorts.). Optimal cutoff points in the validation cohort for the COVID-IRS-NLR score and the COVID-IRS-IL6 were >6 (S: 68.57%, E: 87.5%) and >5 (S: 72.86%, E: 81.67%). Table 2 depicts the comparison between the AUC of all scores. When compared to other scores, the AUC of both COVID-IRS scores was superior to that shown by all other calculated risk scores in both the development and validation cohorts.\n","In this study, we developed two novel prognostic scores for the prediction of IMV requirement in COVID-19 patients, using variables registered upon hospital admission. ROC analysis of data derived from both the development and the validation cohorts revealed an excellent performance of the NLR-based as well as of the IL-6-based scores. Importantly, according to our analysis, the NLR proved to be an outstanding surrogate of IL-6. When compared with other similar scores developed for the prediction of adverse outcomes in COVID-19, the COVID-IRS scores proved to be superior in the prediction of IMV.\n","We believe that the biomarkers used in the COVID-IRS scores (respiratory rate, SaO2/FiO2 ratio, LDH, and either IL-6 or NLR), accurately represent relevant aspects of the clinical phenomena seen in severe COVID-19. Both, the respiratory rate and the SaO2/FiO2 ratio evaluate ventilatory function, whose deterioration is the main component associated with COVID-19 mortality [9, 10]. The SaO2/FiO2 ratio was used as a surrogate for the PaO2/FiO2 ratio due to its availability and because it maintains a close linear relationship with O2-CO2 exchange and blood oxygenation [11]. LDH is involved in the anaerobic metabolism of glucose and thus, is upregulated when oxygen supplies are limited [12]. LDH levels are increased in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and have been associated with adverse outcomes and consistently included in COVID-19 severity scores [12]. Finally, IL-6 and the NLR reflect the severity of the ongoing inflammatory process and immune dysregulation [13–16]. IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine mainly secreted by activated macrophages in response to any aggressor. It promotes the production of acute phase reactants and the proliferation of myeloid cells, as well as neutrophil survival in lung tissue [17, 18]. On the other hand, neutrophils as effectors of the innate immune system may reflect the severity of pneumonia and have been used as markers of poor prognosis in different inflammatory states, such as sepsis [17]. Lymphocytes, another important cell of the immune system, are recruited to damaged tissues and in the context of COVID-19 tend to migrate to lung and blood vessels, which partially accounts for the low peripheral lymphocyte count seen in these patients [19, 20]. Thus, a high NLR is a reflection of the severity of the ongoing inflammatory process [21–23].\n","Both IL-6 and NLR have been used as prognostic markers in both, influenza and community-acquired pneumonia [24]. It therefore seemed logical to try to use them as predictive biomarkers in patients with SARS-Cov-2 pneumonia [24, 25]. Since the beginning of the pandemic leukocytosis, lymphopenia and high levels of IL-6 have been consistently associated with poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19 infection [25]. The correlation between NLR and IL-6 has been previously described in other clinical contexts [11, 18]. Our study is perhaps the first one to evaluate the equivalency between the NLR and the serum levels of IL-6 in the context of COVID-19 severity. Even though both measurements seem to accurately reflect severity, IL-6 measurements require specialized equipment and are only readily available in few centers, while the NLR only requires a CBC, which is inexpensive and widely available [19, 20].\n","Different prognostic scores for COVID-19 have been developed using different variables, including the presence of comorbidities, age, absolute lymphocyte count, LDH, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and bilateral opacities on CT scan in order to identify patients at risk of adverse outcomes [26–30]. There are some predictive scores with similar applications to the COVID-IRS score. The COVID-GRAM score was created to calculate the probability of developing critical COVID-19 using data from 1590 Chinese patients. The AUC on both the development and the validation cohorts were 0.88 [27]. Another score is the ABC-GOALS, developed to predict ICU admission, and is based on data from 329 patients admitted to a COVID-19 reference center in Mexico City. The ABC-GOALS score has 3 versions, a clinical only model (ABC-GOALSc), a clinical and laboratory model (ABC-GOALScl), and a clinical, laboratory and x-ray model (ABC-GOALSclx). We only compared our data with the ABC-GOALScl score, due to our lack of more precise CT scan interpretation data in our dataset. The AUC of the ABC-GOALScl score was 0.86 and 0.87 in its development and validation cohorts, respectively. More recently the PREDICO score has been developed for the prediction of severe respiratory failure, using the data of 1265 patients from eleven Italian hospitals. The AUC was of 0.89 and 0.85 in its development and validation cohorts. All the aforementioned scores have several variables in common with the COVID-IRS score like LDH, Lymphocyte count (NLR in the COVID-GRAM score), respiratory rate and SaO2/FiO2 ratio [29]. Even though both these scores were not developed for the specific identification of patients that were going to require IMV, they achieved lower AUC when they were tested directly in our population, in both the development and validation cohorts (COVID-GRAM: 0.787 and 0.773; ABC-GOALScl: 0.765 and 0.739). As mentioned earlier, both COVID-IRS was superior to the COVID-GRAM and ABC-GOALScl scores at predicting the need for IMV. Additionally, the Brescia-COVID Respiratory Severity Scale (BCRSS), a stepwise approach to managing patients with confirmed/presumed COVID-19 pneumonia [31], is a meaningful tool based on clinical features and chest x-ray changes, for determining the scalation in ventilatory support. It is meant to be dynamic and frequently reassessed and re-scored after interventions and has been widely used in that center for evaluating patients from de emergency department and throughout hospitalization. We weren’t able to estimate and compare the BCRSS’s performance in our cohort to predict the IMV risk, due to lack of information in our records. Finally, all variables needed to calculate the COVID-GRAM, ABC-GOALScl, PREDI-CO and COVID-IRS-NLR scores can be easily obtained in the outpatient setting and could complement each other. Of important note the SOFA score had a similar AUC when compared with the COVID-IRS scores for predicting IMV. Due to the retrospective nature of our data, we did not distinguish patients who needed IMV on arrival or first day of admission from those who were intubated during their hospital stay, and when taking into consideration that the SOFA score includes a variable for IMV, this most likely results in an overestimation of its capacity to predict the need for IMV in our population.\n","It is important to emphasize that some high-risk patients may not present with signs of respiratory distress upon admission, but can rapidly progress to ARDS, and thus need frequent monitoring [9, 29, 30]. In order to avoid overwhelming of health care systems worldwide, the identification of these patients is a priority. The timely identification of these cases could help to reduce mortality and allow a reasonable and cost-effective allocation of human resources and infrastructure [5, 31]. One of the possible benefits of our score, comes from its utility in identifying which patients require this closer surveillance and which can have their evaluations spaced-out safely. We identified four risk categories according to the probability of requiring IMV: low, moderate, high and very high risk. Low-risk patients have a low probability of requiring IMV and could benefit from a strategy that offers early discharge from the hospital and subsequent ambulatory visits. Patients with moderate-risk scores could remain in a hospital ward for surveillance. Finally, the high-risk and very high-risk category patients have an IMV probability of over 31.8%, and could therefore should be kept in a ward that has enough personnel to provide frequent re-evaluations and prompt response times for emergency endotraqueal intubation (like intermediate care units). Further studies are needed in order to validate this application of the COVID-IRS.\n","The main limitations of our study are its retrospective nature and the fact that some of the patients received different medical treatments prior to hospitalization (such as glucocorticoids) which could act as confounders. Our results may not be representative of the general real-life situation prevailing in most COVID-19 centers; our mortality rate is rather low, which can be attributed to the availability of ICU facilities. Finally, the incidence of comorbidities and old age in our cohort is lower than that reported in other centers and could thus prove to be a factor that hampers its application in other settings.\n","\n"," -------------------------------------------------- \n","\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"KbwzWqz-spJd"},"source":["# 9.
