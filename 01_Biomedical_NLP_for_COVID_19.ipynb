The meta-analysis included five randomized controlled trials with a total of 591 patients treated by four different agents: arbidol, favipiravir, lopinavir-ritonavir, and hydroxychloroquine. Based on the surface under the cumulative ranking curve probabilities calculated for each treatment, the authors concluded that hydroxychloroquine had the highest treatment efficiency. Later, a random effects network meta-analysis by Siemienuk et al (13) showed that patients receiving corticosteroids had a lower risk of death and mechanical ventilation than those randomized to standard care. Using a similar method, Zhang et al (14) showed that, among 19 agents investigated, dexamethasone led to the lowest risk of mortality and mechanical ventilation compared with the standard of care.

A systematic review and meta-analysis by Chu et al (16), based on frequentist and Bayesian meta-analyses and random effects meta-regression, showed that physical distancing of 1 m or more and optimum use of face masks, respirators, and eye protection significantly contributed to the prevention of the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover (17), in a Bayesian network meta-analysis, Yin et al showed that continuous wearing of N95 respirators throughout the shift could serve as the best preventive measure for health care workers compared with other protective equipment. The Bayesian framework has also been implemented in the estimation of the secondary attack rate of COVID-19, ie, the probability of the disease spread in close-contact environments (eg, family, household, dormitory, etc), which can be influenced by many factors, including personal hygiene, social behaviors, and features of close-contact environments. Namely, Huang et al (18) estimated that the secondary attack rate of COVID-19 in Taiwan was 0.42%-1.69% at the time when their results were published and predicted that in the future it would range 0.08%-8.32%. Finally, a Bayesian meta-analysis has also been implemented for investigating the association of smoking status with SARS-CoV-2 infection and the course and outcome of the disease. Carmona-Bayonas et al (19) concluded that, similar to other respiratory disorders, active smoking increased the severity of COVID-19, while Simons et al (20) showed that current and former smokers, compared with never smokers, were at increased risk of hospitalization, increased disease severity, and mortality.\nIn the last ten years, Bayesian meta-analysis was predominantly implemented in medical research, neuroscience, and psychology. Still, we recognized the Bayesian approach's advantages in other fields, such as computer science, environmental science, social sciences, engineering, and economics. For example, Thompson and Semma (21) introduced Bayesian meta-analysis of data from adolescent development research. The authors assessed the impact of media literacy interventions on media literacy skills and attitudes, and risky health behaviors. Apart from demonstrating how to compute and interpret several meta-analytical quantities, they also discussed the advantages and disadvantages of the frequentist and Bayesian methods and provided the full R code used for their research. As an example from medical research, Charkos et al (22) used the Bayesian framework to conduct a meta-analysis of research on the association between thiazide diuretics and hip fracture risk. By analyzing 12 cohort studies including 2 537 871 participants, the authors showed that thiazide diuretics were associated with a lower risk of hip fracture, suggesting that these substances could have a significant role in protecting the general populations from hip fracture. Additionally, Fang et al (23) showed that fluconazole reduced the risk of the mycological cure rate in oral candidiasis better than other tested drugs.\nBayesian meta-analysis has also been implemented to evaluate the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions on agitation in people with dementia. Based on data from 65 randomized controlled trials, Leng et al (24) confirmed that non-pharmacological interventions effectively ameliorate agitation in people with dementia and should be applied during routine care. In environmental sciences and agriculture, Bayesian approaches have been used to estimate the value of reducing eutrophication in marine areas in Europe (25), synthesize decay rate constant estimates for common fecal indicator bacteria (26), as well as assess the effects of fasting, transport, and lairage times on the attributes of pork meat quality (27), to name a few topics. The use of meta-analysis in ecology has been growing since the 1990s, and meta-analysis has been used to discern general patterns from data on various species and study sites. Due to the sizeable among-study variation in effect sizes, the Bayesian framework could be a promising tool for performing meta-analyses in the field. A review article by Pappalardo et al (28) compared the traditional and Bayesian approaches to ecological meta-analysis, concluding that using the frequentist and Bayesian framework should depend on the type of research and the quality and quantity of the available data.\nAs shown, Bayesian meta-analysis already has a diverse and practical application today. The main advantage of the method is appropriately taking into account the uncertainty around the heterogeneity variance. The frequentist approaches use the point estimate of the heterogeneity variance as a fixed quantity, which leads to variability underestimation. Furthermore, the Bayesian meta-analysis enables us to perform sensitivity analyses by changing distributional assumptions and incorporate a priori knowledge in the model. All this shows that Bayesian meta-analysis should not be considered as a competitive method of frequentist meta-analysis, but only as an additional tool that can help us achieve a much more reliable result. So let's go! Let the Bayesian approach enrich your next meta-analysis.</br></br>UNKNOWN URL AND TITLE</br></br>Antibiotic resistance (ABR) is currently identified as one of the biggest threats to not only global health but also to food security and development1. Resistance occurs when the antibiotics (medicines used to prevent and treat bacterial infections) are no longer effective at inhibiting the growth of the bacteria1. There is a growing increase of resistance by bacteria to antibiotics2–10 with the World Health Organization (WHO) through its Global Antimicrobial Surveillance System (GLASS) report revealing that there are high levels of antibiotic resistance in both low- and high-income countries11. In fact, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) reported that 25,000 people died of diseases caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria in 2007, which is over half the number caused by road traffic accidents in the same countries12. In 2015, this number increased to about 33,000 deaths resulting from an estimated 671,689 infections of selected antibiotic-resistant bacteria leading to 874,541 total disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs)13. This indicates that the burden in the European Union and European Economic Area is on the rise. Likewise, the World Health Organization (WHO) predicted that by 2050, the number of people who will die due to antibiotic resistance would increase from 700,000 to about 10 million per year globally14. As a result of antibiotic resistance, more than 2.8 million people are infected, and more than 35,000 die each year in the USA15,16.\nThe burden caused by antibiotic resistance is greater in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) whose health care systems are poor and lack tools to perform rapid diagnosis of the numerous neglected infectious diseases17. In the community settings in LMICs, high prevalence of multidrug-, extensive drug-, and pan drug-resistant commensal Escherichia coli isolated from healthy humans has been reported18. Thus, greater efforts should be placed in LMICs to contain the spread of antibiotic-resistant E. coli, especially with its relaxed antibiotics prescription policies. Antibiotic resistance has led to an increase in poverty in LMICs16, and antibiotics misuse is associated with the carriage of resistant commensal E. coli from healthy children in community settings worldwide19,20. In high-income countries, stringent antibiotic prescription policies are in place to reverse the course of antibiotic resistance21.\nCommensal Escherichia coli is a gram-negative bacterium located in the gut of humans, animals, birds, and also exists in the environment22. It is a pathogen on the WHO global critical pathogen priority list for research, discovery, and new antibiotics development23. When we ingest antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial infections, the commensal E. coli is exposed to these antibiotics and can develop resistance to these antibiotics through natural selection24. Indeed, commensal E. coli is one of the major reservoirs for the transmission of antibiotic resistance to other pathogenic bacteria through plasmid exchange, for example (Fig. 1)25–32. Humans can be exposed to viable commensal antibiotic-resistant E. coli by contact with livestock or a contaminated natural environment and by inadequately cooked food or cross-contamination33–35.\nMany studies have shown a high prevalence of resistance to antibiotics by pathogenic and commensal bacteria in healthcare settings8. However, when comparing these studies to those conducted in community settings there is a large discrepancy, especially in LMICs36. This is as a result of the fact that little attention is given at the community level to contain the global antibiotic resistance crises; despite some studies that compare the prevalence of resistance to antibiotics in both communities and hospitals all showed consistently high values with no significant difference8,22,37–40. Thus, similar attention should be given to contain the cause of resistance to antibiotics by bacteria in communities, as is the case in hospitals. If this situation is not addressed, many of the gains in modern medicine will be lost and the commitment to achieve universal health coverage by world leaders will be in vain7,41. In this paper, we aim to provide an appraisal of the evidence of the high prevalence of antibiotic resistance by commensal E. coli to commonly prescribed antibiotics in community settings (i.e., locations outside the hospital such as homes and schools) in LMICs to bring to light the extent of the problem and inform interventions targeted at controlling and preventing antibiotic resistance. Indeed, a multitude of knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP), education, and community engagement interventions exist in community settings in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), yet data to support and justify their set-up are often lacking. Thus, our data should prove useful to support the course for the fight against antibiotic resistance by researchers, community pharmacists, public health policymakers, advocacy groups, farmers, among others. A collective approach involving every country to fight antibiotic resistance is crucial to reduce the mortality, morbidity, associated health and healthcare costs, and the spread of resistant bacteria10,42.\nA total of 9363 articles were obtained from the search (PubMed = 3634, EMBASE + MEDLINE = 2103, Web of Science = 3046, CINAHL = 290 and Cochrane Library = 289). Out of the 9363 articles, 2280 duplicates were removed using EndNote X8. We screened 7089 articles to identify article hits that met our inclusion criteria (Fig. 2). We performed a full-text screening of 53 studies and data were extracted from 33 articles8,28,29,43–72. A total of 20 articles in which the isolates were pathogenic (14), were collected in a high-income country (3), could not be obtained online (2), or review articles (1) were excluded for data extraction.\nOut of the 33 included studies, 10 were from Africa, 13 from Asia, 1 from Europe, 8 from South America, and 1 from multiple locations (Fig. 3a,d). The quality of the evidence was assessed as described previously74,75. Of the 33 studies, 16 were marked as high quality, 16 as a medium, and 1 as low quality (Fig. 3b). These included studies were cross-sectional (25), cohort (6), case–control (1), and double-blind randomized control trials (1) (Fig. 3c).\nThe included studies comprise of about 7755 health individuals in community settings from 0 to 77 years of age from 1989 to 2019. One limitation of this study is that some articles did not record the number of males and females, thus it was challenging to determine the ratio of males to females. However, we calculated the number of males and females using the studies that recorded the numbers. Of these studies, 2443 were males and 2010 were females. Thus, assuming a total population of 7755, we extrapolated the number of males to be 4255, and females 3500.\nThe pooled prevalence of commensal E. coli isolated from healthy individuals in community settings in LMICs for the different antibiotics are summarized in Table 1, Fig. 4, and Supplementary Fig. 1. A high prevalence was seen for some of the commonly prescribed antibiotics in these countries like ampicillin (72%, 95% CI: 65–79), cefotaxime (27%, 95% CI: 12–44), chloramphenicol (45%, 95% CI: 35–53), ciprofloxacin (17%, 95% CI: 11–25), co-trimoxazole (63%, 95% CI: 52–73, nalidixic acid (30%, 95% CI: 21–40), oxytetracycline (78%, 95% CI: 65–88), streptomycin (58%, 95% CI: 44–72), tetracycline (67%, 95% CI: 59–74), and trimethoprim (67%, 95% CI: 59–75). These findings will be very useful for evidence-based health policy design aimed at combating the spread of antibiotic resistance in the community.\nIn this study, the prevalence of resistance was collected for a range of diverse antibiotics and mechanisms of actions such as, inhibition of protein, nucleic acid, folic acid, or cell wall synthesis. For some antibiotics, the resistance was very high, others were emerging, and for some it was low (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 4). This evidence should prove useful to inform antibiotic stewardship programs.\nThe results show a high I2 value, which indicates considerable heterogeneity. Funnel plots and Egger’s regression test was used to explore the sources of heterogeneity. The funnel plots for all antibiotics were asymmetrical (Supplementary Fig. 2), thus indicating a possibility of publication bias. We further investigate the existence of publication bias per antibiotic using Egger’s regression test (Supplementary Table 5). Most of the antibiotics (ampicillin, cefotaxime, co-trimoxazole, nalidixic acid, streptomycin, and trimethoprim) did not exhibit publication bias. The antibiotics that exhibited publication bias were chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, oxytetracycline, and tetracycline. On further stratification of each antibiotic prevalence, according to continents (Africa, South America, and Asia), there was a reduced likelihood of publication bias based on visual examination of the funnel plot.\nAntibiotic resistance (ABR) is a serious global health threat that needs to be addressed urgently2–8. ABR's impact is particularly greater in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), which bear the highest-burden and subsequently suffer the most from this problem, primarily because their healthcare systems lack the resources needed to contain or to treat challenging infectious diseases caused by drug-resistant bacteria17. Indeed, it has led to an increase in poverty in LMICs16. While there has been a general increase in multidrug-resistant pathogenic bacteria in community settings77 recent evidence suggests that the prevalence of multidrug-resistant commensal Escherichia coli isolated from healthy individuals is particularly high in LMICs18. In this study, we synthesized a total of 33 articles to obtain a pooled prevalence of ABR in the top ten antibiotics commonly prescribed in community settings (i.e., locations outside of a hospital, such as schools and homes) in LMICs.\nThere are several factors that contribute to ABR78, with a complicated inter-relationship that spans across different sectors outside of healthcare alone, such as agriculture and industry. Among the main factors identified leading to resistance in commensal E. coli in LMICs are overcrowding, poverty, socioecological behaviours, food and supply chain safety issues, highly contaminated waste effluents and inadequate surveillance systems79. Nevertheless, the primary driver of multidrug-resistance in LMICs has been misuse and over-prescription of antibiotics80. Commensal E. coli are typically present in the guts of humans, animals, birds, as well as in the environment, and can develop resistance to antibacterial agents through natural selection when ingested for the treatment of bacterial infections22,24.\nThis review revealed a high prevalence of antibiotic resistance in commensal E. coli to the most prescribed antibiotics in LMICs. Moreover, this was a consistent finding across several classes of antibiotics with different mechanisms of action. For instance, the pooled prevalence of antibiotic resistance for the β-lactam antibiotic ampicillin was 72%, 95% CI: 65–79, while for trimethoprim, a folic acid synthesis inhibitor, the pooled prevalence was 67%, 95% CI: 59–75. Similar observations were reported in a recent systematic review investigating ABR in E. coli strains isolated from humans, animals, food, and the environment in several middle- and high-income countries. The authors presented high rates of resistance against a range of antibiotics found in E. coli isolates, although the pooled prevalence was generally lower than in the isolates from healthy individuals from LMICs presented here81. For ciprofloxacin, the pooled prevalence from our study was 17%, 95% CI: 11–25, which is in the range of the resistance seen for treating E. coli associated urinary tract infection (8% to 65%)11, and other E. coli isolated from farmed minks in Zhucheng, China76. Likewise, for cotrimoxazole, our data (63%, 95% CI, 52–73) agrees with another study carried out in Zimbabwe, where the prevalence was 68% for Gram-negative bacillli82. The main limitation of our study is the fact that the heterogeneity between studies was very high (Table 1, Fig. 4). We performed an additional statistical analysis stratified by continent. The goal was to solve the heterogeneity issue, however, there was no significant difference between the pooled prevalence of antibiotic resistance values between continents. The high heterogeneity between studies could stem from the different factors associated with the carriage resistant commensal E. coli in LMICs highlighted in the discussion section above. Since I2 statistics test for heterogeneity can be misleading during meta-analysis of observational studies83,84, we performed an alternative assessment of the strength of evidence of the different studies (supplementary table 3)74,75. The included studies utilized disc diffusion or synergy test to investigate the expression of resistant genes in the presence of antibiotics. However, those that employed an additional method, such as PCR, plasmid transfer assay, nucleic acid identification, mass spectrometry, to validate the presence of genes conferring resistance to a particular antibiotic were graded as high.\nOur study is in line with the WHO’s Global action plan on antimicrobial resistance, which calls for improved awareness of the problems arising from antibiotic resistance as stated in one of the five strategic objectives85. Indeed, raising awareness can be facilitated, for example, through the making of participatory videos86. As expected, in this study, resistance was commonly detected from stool samples collected from healthy volunteers in community settings. Our findings have important ramifications for public health policies and antibiotic resistance stewardship through a one-health approach for the fight against ABR. In some of the studies screened, factors such as previous antibiotic use19,55,59,65, geographical location8,57, age8,59, socioeconomic status43,55,57, and exposure to animals49,65 were highlighted as being associated with a high prevalence of resistance. The situation is even more pressing with the emergence of global pandemics such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)87. Prior to the availability of approved vaccines, different medicines have been tested randomly in clinical trials to find a cure for this deadly pandemic87–94. Since viral infections are often associated with bacterial infections95,96, the antibiotic <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightorange; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">azithromycin<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">chemical</span>\n</mark> in combination with the antimalarial <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightgreen; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">drug<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">usages</span>\n</mark> hydroxychloroquine was proposed as an option for the treatment of COVID19 patients97. Thus, we may see a post-COVID19 global health crisis with a surge in antibiotic resistance leading to many deaths97.\nThis study provides further evidence of the high prevalence of antibiotic resistant commensal E. coli from healthy human sources in community settings in LMICs. These findings should encourage health researchers, medical professionals, advocacy groups, and health policymakers to work together to develop appropriate interventions to counteract this growing global health threat. We recommend that the strategies that have been implemented in healthcare settings to contain the spread of resistance, such as surveillance, raising awareness, improve sanitation and hygiene, rapid diagnosis of diseases, and stringent prescription policies should also be urgently implemented in the communities to curb antibiotic resistance.\nA systematic approach was used to retrieve and synthesize studies that met our inclusion criteria following PRISMA guidelines73.\nThe types of studies included in the systematic review are those in which the main outcome was the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in commensal Escherichia coli: cross-sectional, case–control, cohort studies, and randomized control trials.\nThis review included studies concerning the general healthy populations in community settings in LMICs.\n\nThe primary outcome was prevalence of resistance to antibiotic by commensal E. coli in community settings in LMICs.The secondary outcomes were: odds ratio, risk ratio, rate, 95% confidence interval, and p-value.\nArticles written in English language were included from 1989 to May 2020 in LMICs. Articles containing studies conducted in a country that was classified as a LMIC before transforming into a high-income country according to the World Bank definition were also included. The included studies must investigate the resistance of commensal E. coli on either solid or liquid growth media in the presence of antibiotics.\nStudies were eligible for inclusion if they reported at least one of the primary or secondary outcomes listed in the outcome of interest section above.\nPublished data from PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Web of Science, CINAHL and Cochrane Library, reference lists of selected studies and unpublished data such as abstracts from Conference proceedings; dissertations and theses were the data sources.\nA literature search was performed on the 10th of March 2018 and was updated on the 18th of May 2020. Briefly, we searched PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library using MeSH terms for PubMed and the comparable terms for the other databases. The search terms were “E. coli OR Escherichia coli OR Enterobacteriaceae” AND \"antibiotic resistance OR antimicrobial resistance OR drug resistance” AND \"prevalence OR incidence OR morbidity OR odd ratio OR risk ratio OR confidence interval OR p-value OR rate\". For PubMed, EMBASE, and MEDLINE, studies performed in humans were selected using the Species filters. While for Web of Science and Cochrane Library additional search words were added to select for species (human* OR infant* OR child* OR adolescen* OR male* OR female OR age OR adult*) since there was no sorting filter for species. For CINAHL, no selection for species was performed. Search words were designed from the different categories in the PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) format. Details of the search terms used are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. The articles obtained from the search were exported to EndNote for duplicate removal. The unique hits were further exported to Rayyan QCRI website for screening and data extraction98. An initial screening was performed by title and abstract, followed by full article text.\nA two-step process was followed involving screening of titles and abstracts to identify relevant articles, which was followed by full-text reading of the relevant articles. A total of 53 full-text articles were screened, and the data extracted and recorded on an excel spreadsheet by five researchers. To exclude selection bias, a sixth researcher was available to solve the disagreements that arose during the data extraction. The parameters that were extracted are listed in Supplementary Table 2. The quality of evidence in the included studies was assessed as described before72,73 (Supplementary Table 3). In brief, studies that utilized disc diffusion or synergy test in combination with one of the following biochemical test such as, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), plasmid transfer assay (PTA), pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), nucleic acid sequencing, and mass spectrometry to detect the presence of resistant genes was graded as high. Furthermore, studies which use only disc diffusion of synergy test with a sample size less than 15 were classified as medium. Lastly, studies which sample size of below 15 and utilized only disc diffusion or synergy test were classified as low.\nStatistical analysis was performed in Stata99 and JBI SUMARI100. The prevalence of antibiotic resistance of commensal E. coli was defined as the proportion of the isolates in a specific study that were found to be resistant to a given antibiotics presented as a percentage. The pooled prevalence was calculated using the metaprop command in Stata101. Metaprop pools proportions and presents a weighted sub-group and overall pooled estimates with inverse-variance weights obtained from a random-effects model. In this case, it involved a meta-analysis of the prevalence values of the individual publications weighted on sample size while accounting for potential heterogeneity between studies. For JBI SUMARI, proportional meta-analysis was calculated using the random-effects model of Freeman-Tukey transformation. Besides, a forest plot was constructed for each of the top ten most reported antibiotics in our study.\nThe source of heterogeneity was explored by stratifying the pooled prevalence by year of sample analysis (study period), geographical location (continents), and type of antibiotic. Funnel plots of overall effect size were run to determine the existence of publication bias by visual inspection. Also, the Egger’s test was used to assess the occurrence of small size effect. The level of significance was maintained at 0.05.</br></br>UNKNOWN URL AND TITLE</br></br>One of the many challenges for clinical trials during a pandemic such as COVID-19 is the need to provide reliable and clear answers rapidly. High-quality, adequately powered, simple randomised clinical trials have been crucial in advancing knowledge of potential treatments for COVID-19.1 Principles underpinning such trials include the use of the uncertainty principle to determine eligibility, which allows for rapid enrolment of participants and streamlined data collection, making these studies easy to implement in routine practice.2 Platform and adaptive trial designs further improve the large, simple trial concept, allowing investigation of multiple experimental therapies throughout the trial with sufficient statistical power for clinically relevant outcomes.3\n\nRECOVERY represents a large, simple, randomised platform trial.

Ongoing randomised clinical trials from these collaborative research efforts and from other groups are testing other potential therapies for COVID-19 such as anticoagulants, newer antivirals, anti-inflammatories, and immunomodulatory agents. Results from these studies will help to inform treatment decisions in clinical practice. The experience and the knowledge gained from successfully launching these studies in a matter of weeks has important implications for research not only in COVID-19 but also for future pandemics and for common diseases.12 Finally, innovations such as big data technologies and linkage with electronic health records, mobile applications, and wearable devices can further transform pragmatic randomised clinical trials, making them larger, more efficient, and easier to implement.\n\n\n</br></br>UNKNOWN URL AND TITLE</br></br>Eye health and vision have widespread and profound implications for many aspects of life, health, sustainable development, and the economy. Yet nowadays, many people, families, and populations continue to suffer the consequences of poor access to high-quality, affordable eye care, leading to vision impairment and blindness.\nIn 2020, an estimated 596 million people had distance vision impairment worldwide, of whom 43 million were blind. Another 510 million people had uncorrected near vision impairment, simply because of not having reading spectacles. A large proportion of those affected (90%), live in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, encouragingly, more than 90% of people with vision impairment have a preventable or treatable cause with existing highly cost-effective interventions. Eye conditions affect all stages of life, with young children and older people being particularly affected. Crucially, women, rural populations, and ethnic minority groups are more likely to have vision impairment, and this pervasive inequality needs to be addressed. By 2050, population ageing, growth, and urbanisation might lead to an estimated 895 million people with distance vision impairment, of whom 61 million will be blind. Action to prioritise eye health is needed now.\nThis Commission defines eye health as maximised vision, ocular health, and functional ability, thereby contributing to overall health and wellbeing, social inclusion, and quality of life. Eye health is essential to achieve many of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Poor eye health and impaired vision have a negative effect on quality of life and restrict equitable access to and achievement in education and the workplace. Vision loss has substantial financial implications for affected individuals, families, and communities. Although high-quality data for global economic estimates are scarce, particularly for LMICs, conservative assessments based on the latest prevalence figures for 2020 suggest that annual global productivity loss from vision impairment is approximately US$410·7 billion purchasing power parity. Vision impairment reduces mobility, affects mental wellbeing, exacerbates risk of dementia, increases likelihood of falls and road traffic crashes, increases the need for social care, and ultimately leads to higher mortality rates.\nBy contrast, vision facilitates many daily life activities, enables better educational outcomes, and increases work productivity, reducing inequality. An increasing amount of evidence shows the potential for vision to advance the SDGs, by contributing towards poverty reduction, zero hunger, good health and wellbeing, quality education, gender equality, and decent work. Eye health is a global public priority, transforming lives in both poor and wealthy communities. Therefore, eye health needs to be reframed as a development as well as a health issue and given greater prominence within the global development and health agendas.\nVision loss has many causes that require promotional, preventive, treatment, and rehabilitative interventions. Cataract, uncorrected refractive error, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy are responsible for most global vision impairment. Research has identified treatments to reduce or eliminate blindness from all these conditions; the priority is to deliver treatments where they are most needed. Proven eye care interventions, such as cataract surgery and spectacle provision, are among the most cost-effective in all of health care. Greater financial investment is needed so that millions of people living with unnecessary vision impairment and blindness can benefit from these interventions.\nLessons from the past three decades give hope that this challenge can be met. Between 1990 and 2020, the age-standardised global prevalence of blindness fell by 28·5%. Since the 1990s, prevalence of major infectious causes of blindness—onchocerciasis and trachoma—have declined substantially. Hope remains that by 2030, the transmission of onchocerciasis will be interrupted, and trachoma will be eliminated as a public health problem in every country worldwide. However, the ageing population has led to a higher crude prevalence of age-related causes of blindness, and thus an increased total number of people with blindness in some regions.\nKey messagesEye health is essential to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals; vision needs to be reframed as a development issueThere is extensive evidence showing that improving eye health contributes directly and indirectly to achieving many Sustainable Development Goals, including reducing poverty and improving work productivity, general and mental health, and education and equity. Improving eye health is a practical and cost-effective way of unlocking human potential. Eye health needs to be reframed as an enabling, cross-cutting issue within the sustainable development framework.Almost everyone will experience impaired vision or an eye condition during their lifetime and require eye care services; urgent action is necessary to meet the rapidly growing eye health needIn 2020, 1·1 billion people had distance vision impairment or uncorrected presbyopia. By 2050, this figure is expected to rise to 1·8 billion. Most affected people live in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) with avoidable causes of vision impairment. During the life course, most people will experience vision impairment, even if just the need for reading glasses. Because of unmet needs and an ageing global population, eye health is a major public health and sustainable development concern which warrants urgent political action.Eye health is an essential component of universal health coverage; it must be included in planning, resourcing, and delivery of health careUniversal health coverage is not universal without affordable, high quality, equitable eye care. In line with the WHO World report on vision, we urge countries to consider eye care as an essential service within universal health coverage. To deliver comprehensive services including promotion, prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation, eye care needs to be included in national strategic health plans and development policies, health financing structures, and health workforce planning. Coordinated intersectoral action is needed to systematically improve population eye health, also within healthy ageing initiatives, schools, and the workplace. Integration of eye health services with multiple relevant components of health service delivery and at all levels of the health system is of central importance.High quality eye health services are not universally delivered; concerted action is needed to improve quality and outcomes, providing effective, efficient, safe, timely, equitable, and people-centred careUse of effective service coverage indicators for cataract and refractive error highlight the delivery gap between population eye health needs and the delivery of good outcomes. We urge eye health providers to take a holistic view to emphasise quality and design service delivery based on individual and population needs: a people-centred approach. Services need to be characterised by inclusiveness and equity in design and delivery, proactively addressing the needs of marginalised and vulnerable groups through targeted interventions. To encourage improved quality in cataract surgery, we support redefining a good vision outcome threshold as 6/12 or better.Highly cost-effective vision-restoring interventions offer enormous potential to improve the economic outlook of individuals and nations; a major scale up of financial investment in eye health is requiredFor 2020, we estimate that vision impairment resulted in $410·7 billion lost economic productivity; the full cost is most likely higher. Treatments for cataract and refractive error would meet more than 90% of unmet needs and are highly cost-effective. The case for countries to invest in improving population eye health is compelling and more financial resources are urgently required.Financial barriers to accessing eye care leave many people behind; eye health needs to be included in national health financing to pool the riskHealth-care costs prevent many people from accessing essential eye health services. Eye care needs to be integrated into general health system financing to remove cost barriers. To improve access for the whole population and mitigate eye care expenditure, mechanisms that pool risk are highly desirable.Technology and treatment developments offer new tools to improve eye health; thoughtful application is needed to maximise the potential to improve coverage, accessibility, quality, efficiency, and affordabilityTechnological developments such as telemedicine, mHealth, and artificial intelligence offer the potential to revolutionise eye health care in the next decade by delivering affordable, high-quality services to remote areas. However, caution is needed to ensure all populations benefit from these developments.The eye health workforce is unable to meet population needs in many countries; major expansion in service capacity is required through increased numbers, sharing tasks, strengthened training, enabling work environments, and effective leadershipMany areas have major shortages of personnel working in eye health. The available workforce needs to be distributed according to population need. Quality of training for the workforce needs to be updated, with renewed emphasis on competency. Enabling working environments need to be created, including appropriate support, supervision, and equipment. Long-standing issues of low productivity need to be systematically resolved. Mentoring and other programmes to cultivate an emerging generation of eye health leaders are needed.Reliable survey and service data are key to progress in eye health; robust indicator data are needed to shape change and drive actionTo monitor progress in delivering improved eye health within universal health coverage, a balanced set of robust indicators are needed, which we outlined in this Commission. Service data should be available and used by implementers and policy makers to drive change. We highlight the scarcity of epidemiological data in several regions, which should be addressed as a priority.Research has been crucial to advances in understanding and treating eye disease; solution-focused, contextually relevant research is urgently needed to deliver innovative prevention and treatment strategies and inform implementation of eye health within universal health coverageImplementation research is needed, particularly in LMICs, to guide effective delivery of services within universal health coverage. Discovery research is needed for specific areas that remain without efficacious interventions. The economic impact of vision impairment, and the costs and benefits of interventions are only partly understood; a coordinated global effort to systematically collect data is needed. A step-change in the capacity of LMICs to do contextually relevant eye health research and a greater commitment are needed to improve diversity and inclusion in the research community.\nDespite this progress, business as usual will not keep pace with the demographic trends of an ageing global population or address the inequities that persist in each country. New threats to eye health are emerging, including the worldwide increase in diabetic retinopathy, high myopia, retinopathy of prematurity, and chronic eye diseases of ageing such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration. With the projected increase in such conditions and their associated vision loss over the coming decades, urgent action is needed to develop innovative treatments and deliver services at a greater scale than previously achieved.\nGood eye health at the community and national level has been marginalised as a luxury available to only wealthy or urban areas. Eye health needs to be urgently brought into the mainstream of national health and development policy, planning, financing, and action.\nThe challenge is to develop and deliver comprehensive eye health services (promotion, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation) that address the full range of eye conditions within the context of universal health coverage. Accessing services should not bring the risk of falling into poverty and services should be of high quality, as envisaged by the WHO framework for health-care quality: effective, safe, people-centred, timely, equitable, integrated, and efficient. To this framework we add the need for services to be environmentally sustainable. Universal health coverage is not universal without eye care.\nMultiple obstacles need to be overcome to achieve universal coverage for eye health. Important issues include complex barriers to availability and access to quality services, cost, major shortages and maldistribution of well-trained personnel, and lack of suitable, well maintained equipment and consumables. These issues are particularly widespread in LMICs, but also occur in underserved communities in high-income countries. Strong partnerships need to be formed with natural allies working in areas affected by eye health, such as non-communicable diseases, neglected tropical diseases, healthy ageing, children's services, education, disability, and rehabilitation. The eye health sector has traditionally focused on treatment and rehabilitation, and underused health promotion and prevention strategies to lessen the impact of eye disease and reduce inequality.\nSolving these problems will depend on solutions established from high quality evidence that can guide more effective implementation at scale. Evidence-based approaches will need to address existing deficiencies in the supply and demand. Strategic investments in discovery research, harnessing new findings from diverse fields, and implementation research to guide effective scale up are needed globally. Encouragingly, developments in telemedicine, mobile health, artificial intelligence, and distance learning could potentially enable eye care professionals to deliver higher quality care that is more plentiful, equitable, and cost-effective.\nThis Commission did a Grand Challenges in Global Eye Health prioritisation exercise to highlight key areas for concerted research and action. This exercise has identified a broad set of challenges spanning the fields of epidemiology, health systems, diagnostics, therapeutics, and implementation. The most compelling of these issues, picked from among 3400 suggestions proposed by 336 people from 118 countries, can help to frame the future research agenda for global eye health.\nIn this Commission, we harness lessons learned from over two decades, present the growing evidence for the life-transforming impact of eye care, and provide a thorough understanding of rapid developments in the field. This report was created through a broad consultation involving experts within and outside the eye care sector to help inform governments and other stakeholders about the path forward for eye health beyond 2020, to further the SDGs (including universal health coverage), and work towards a world without avoidable vision loss.\nThe next few years are a crucial time for the global eye health community and its partners in health care, government, and other sectors to consider the successes and challenges encountered in the past two decades, and at the same time to chart a way forward for the upcoming decades. Moving forward requires building on the strong foundation laid by WHO and partners in VISION 2020 with renewed impetus to ultimately deliver high quality universal eye health care for all.\nThis Commission views global eye health through the global health framework articulated by Koplan and colleagues.4 Eye health started with an understanding of the anatomy, physiology, diseases of the eye, and the development of clinical ophthalmology, the medical and surgical discipline for diagnosis and treatment of eye diseases. From the mid-20th century onwards (figure 1), there have been major technological advances in microsurgical techniques for cataract and other conditions, and equipment for diagnosis and treatment of major non-communicable eye diseases, resulting in more effective interventions. There has been an enormous demographic transition, with ageing populations and epidemiological changes from infectious diseases and towards non-communicable diseases, requiring accessible and affordable eye services with long-term follow-up. The increase in demand, emphasis on better quality, and higher cost of more sophisticated diagnostic and treatment services is requiring an increase in resources, which presents enormous public health challenges.\nThere are many lessons from the past 70 years that are instructive for the future of global eye health (appendix 1 p 8). First, the importance of advocacy in creating global platforms to address a public health issue. Second, the value of common definitions, high quality data and research to develop global, regional, and national health programmes. Third, the importance of identifying and addressing specific eye diseases of public health importance that can be eliminated through public–private partnerships. Fourth, that the VISION 2020 initiative created an easily understood message for advocacy and planning services, and a global partnership involving different stakeholders in public health, including the private sector and non-governmental organisations, which resulted in extra resources and a common goal and focus. Fifth, that in promoting a global programme, inadequate attention was given to the engagement and partnership with ministries of health to ensure national ownership. There remains a need to integrate eye care planning and resource allocation into national health systems and share the achievements and successes. Sixth, that the transition from elimination of focal eye diseases with regional programmes and international funding to the development of comprehensive services to achieve universal eye health requires engagement, commitment, and leadership by the ministries of health and the willingness of all stakeholders (including the private sector) to support eye care services integrated within national health-care plans.\nVision is the most dominant of human senses. The eye, its associated adnexal tissues, and visual pathways within the brain are very intricate (figure 2). All these elements need to function well together to achieve clear vision. The transparent optical elements at the front of the eye (cornea and lens) focus light onto retinal photoreceptors. These transduce light stimuli into neuronal impulses with which the brain creates a three-dimensional image. Vision requires structural and physiological integrity of the eyes, brain, and their connections. Disruption of any part of this pathway causes vision impairment.\nOur eyesight has several distinct components that require specific types of testing, including visual acuity (distance and near), contrast sensitivity, colour vision, and visual fields (appendix 1 p 9). Tests of cerebral visual function include interpreting the meaning of a picture or recognising faces. Vision-driven activities of daily living can be captured using quality of life tools and vision function-related tasks. The most common measure of visual function is distance visual acuity, which tests the ability to discern letters or characters of high contrast at decreasing size using the central retina.\nThere have been progressive developments in WHO recommendations on how vision impairment is measured, defined, and categorised, particularly in population-based epidemiological surveys (appendix 1 p 10). International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision (ICD-11) definitions of distance vision impairment were updated in 2019 with additional subdivisions (table 1).5 In the World report on vision,2 WHO has signalled an intention to change the way vision impairment is reported, moving away from only presenting visual acuity (with spectacles or contact lenses if available), to also reporting uncorrected visual acuity (without spectacles or contact lenses if worn). Including the measurement of uncorrected acuity allows for better estimation of the ongoing service need and effective coverage of refractive error correction. In prevalence surveys, vision impairment is generally reported as visual acuity in the better seeing eye. This Commission uses visual acuity categories defined on Snellen charts in metres when presenting data. Moderate and severe vision impairment (MSVI) is defined as visual acuity worse than 6/18, but equal to or better than 3/60, and blindness is defined as worse than 3/60 (table 1).\nMany conditions can affect eye health, and even those that do not cause vision impairment can produce pronounced morbidity. Common eye conditions covering key clinical features, epidemiology, and management are summarised in appendix 1 (pp 11–14). The most common causes of vision impairment in adults are uncorrected refractive error, cataract, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, corneal scarring, and trachoma (figure 2). Among children the leading causes of blindness and MSVI include uncorrected refractive error, cataract, retinopathy of prematurity, congenital ocular anomalies, corneal scarring, and cerebral visual impairment. There are also many conditions causing pronounced symptoms (eg, pain, itching, discharge) and affecting a large number of people without vision impairment. These include infectious and allergic conjunctivitis, blepharitis, and dry eyes. The resulting morbidity needs to be addressed, forming a substantial proportion of ophthalmic service work.6\nPublic health approaches can prevent or treat most common eye diseases. Vision loss and access to eye care is greatly affected by social determinants.7, 8 These encompass many issues: social exclusion, gender inequity, racism, early childhood development, educational opportunities, employment conditions, design and implementation of health systems and public health programmes, urbanisation, globalisation, and commercial determinants.7, 9 Inequity in health, between and within countries, is mostly attributable to social determinants of health.9 We will explore questions on access, equity, and health financing in the wider context of universal health coverage in section 6.10\nLife course perspectives focus on health trajectories during key developmental periods and across the whole lifespan.11 At each stage of life, multiple biological, socioeconomic, and environmental factors interact to determine the development and course of eye health (figure 3).13 Lifelong accumulation of risk factors, particularly during crucial periods of visual development, influence visual function trajectories and underlie marked regional differences in vision impairment.12\nThe socioeconomic environment into which a child is born has profound effects on eye health over the individual's life course. Maternal nutritional and vaccination status, and development of intrauterine infections (rubella, toxoplasmosis, syphilis, Zika) are important determinants.14, 15 Preterm birth can lead to retinopathy of prematurity and cerebral visual impairment. Low birthweight, fetal growth restriction, antenatal maternal smoking and alcohol misuse, and social deprivation in childhood can also cause vision impairment.16, 17 Congenital eye conditions frequently have strong genetic components. Over the life course, biological and social determinants interact to determine visual function. For example, retinoblastoma, a mostly genetically determined childhood eye cancer, is not expected to vary by socioeconomic status. However, socioeconomic and cultural factors that influence timely access and adherence to treatment are responsible for important differences in vision and survival outcomes.18\nVisual acuity develops rapidly after birth and reaches full development at around age 8 years. Early childhood is a crucial period because visual cortex plasticity progressively diminishes after age 2 years. Since vision is important for early child development, early onset vision impairment can lead to psychomotor and cognitive developmental delay.19 Visual stimulus deprivation between birth and age 8 years can lead to permanent vision impairment (amblyopia) if not managed in a timely manner.11 As the eyes grow and change shape there is a further sensitive period from childhood to adolescence when a combination of genetic and environmental factors, such as light exposure and time spent outdoors, can lead to myopia.20 Several infectious diseases (trachoma, toxoplasmosis, onchocerciasis) begin in childhood and lead to vision impairment later in life from accumulated pathology.21, 22\nMany conditions are age-related. Presbyopia starts developing from age 35 years, as the lens ages. Some conditions (eg, glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration) have a complex polygenetic background, which can interact with nutrition and other biological factors.23, 24 Diabetes and diabetic retinopathy are influenced by multiple social and environmental determinants (diet, activity, obesity).25 Cataract arises from multiple factors across the life course that promote lens ageing: ultraviolet light exposure, smoking, poor nutrition, diabetes, and severe dehydration.26\nThe life course trajectory of visual function is not fixed. Many conditions and risk factors are amenable to interventions, including social determinants, along the spectrum of promotion, prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation. These are complex issues, requiring multisectoral approaches (nutrition, housing, social security, education), long-term policies, and health system investment for greater health equity.13, 27\nThe UN SDGs are a group of broad target-driven goals for 2030, designed as a “blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all”.28 We did a series of systematic and scoping reviews to examine the relationship between eye health and the SDGs. Together, these reviews provide compelling evidence that improving access to eye health services will contribute to achieving many SDGs, including the goals to reduce poverty and increased work productivity, health, education, and equity (figure 4). Furthermore, progress towards many SDGs will benefit vision and eye health. Therefore, we believe improving eye health should be viewed principally as a human development issue.\nThis Commission explored the relationship between eye health and general health and wellbeing (SDG3) in six separate reviews, as well as doing a further review on the relation between eye health and the 16 other SDGs (appendix 1 p 15; table 2).57 In terms of these 16 SDGs, we showed that the provision of eye care services is associated with improvements in workplace productivity,29 household consumption,30, 31 household income,32, 33, 34, 35 employment prospects,36 and economic productivity.37, 38, 39, 40 Economic benefits, particularly in resource-limited communities, contribute to achieving SDGs such as poverty reduction (SDG1), food security (SDG2), and decent work (SDG8). An example of benefits resulting from provision of eye care services is shown by the Cataract Impact Study30, 31 done in Kenya, Bangladesh, and the Philippines (appendix 2 p 3).\nEducational performance is linked to vision. Children with vision impairment have poorer educational outcomes and are more likely to be excluded from schools (less likely to attend). We found evidence that providing spectacles to children improves educational performance, supporting quality education (SDG4), with effect sizes at least as large as other health interventions.41, 42, 43, 44, 45 Improved education is crucial to development, reducing poverty and hunger, and enabling work (SDGs 1, 2, and 8).58\nImproving eye health contributes to increased gender equity (SDG5) and reduced inequalities (SDG10).49 Cataract surgery can improve equity, measured by expenditure.31 Women have poorer access to eye health services and more vision impairment; addressing gender inequality will help advance eye health.59 Specific interventions such as community outreach vision screening services increase equity for conditions such as cataract and glaucoma among women, marginalised communities, and older people.51, 60\nImproved eye care can contribute to improving the sustainability of cities and communities (SDG11). Studies52, 53, 54, 55, 56 show that improved vision enhances road safety, thereby contributing to safer cities. Although no studies met our inclusion criteria for the remaining SDGs, we contend that environmentally responsible eye health services would reduce carbon emissions and plastic waste, thereby contributing to progress towards the SDGs for affordable clean energy (SDG7), responsible consumption (SDG12), climate action (SDG13), life below water (SDG14), and life on land (SDG15).61, 62 Unaddressed eye care needs in displaced populations underscore the potential for such interventions to contribute to the resilience of these disadvantaged communities (SDG16).63\nUnderlying all SDGs is SDG17, strengthening partnerships to achieve the goals. The global eye health community provides examples of effective health-care partnerships, including the GET2020 Alliance64 and the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control,65 which have yielded major reductions in the disease burden.\nThe UN places great emphasis on “realization of the SDGs by, for and with persons with disabilities”, including people with vision loss.68 This emphasis recognises that people with vision-related disability play an important part in achieving the SDGs, and their exclusion from schooling and employment is a violation of their rights, as set out in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. For example, children with vision impairment in multiple LMICs are up to five times less likely to be in formal education than children without disabilities.69 In high-income countries, where school attendance is usually mandatory, children with vision impairment often achieve poorer outcomes (appendix 1 p 16)70 and might face social exclusion and violence in schools, impacting their education.71, 72 People with vision impairment also experience reduced employment prospects and are more likely to have low paid work rather than professional jobs.73, 74 Beyond education and employment, vision impairment is linked to social exclusion including the experience of negative attitudes,75 violence and bullying,76 sexual assault,77 and loneliness.\nThe key to promoting the rights of people with vision impairment is to improve functional ability by increasing access to vision rehabilitation services and creating more inclusive environments through strengthening inclusive policies and laws, providing assistive technology, inclusive education and vocational training, advocacy, and creating accessible spaces. To ensure vision rehabilitation is considered as an integral component of eye care services in pursuit of universal health coverage, this Commission calls for adoption of a new definition of eye health, which involves maximised vision, ocular health, and functional ability, thereby contributing to overall health, wellbeing, social inclusion, and quality of life.\nThe International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health model by WHO67 can help to contextualise the impact of vision impairment on a person's life, including walking, eating, education, employment, and social participation (appendix 1 p 16). This model illustrates the importance of environmental factors to maximise participation of people with vision impairment in society, including the opportunity to access vision rehabilitation.\nStudies have shown78, 79, 80 that vision screening and provision of glasses helps to improve educational outcomes for children with vision impairment, and the provision of other types of assistive devices and reading aids is also likely to be effective. However, spectacles are not universally available and the ability to read and write using assistive technology, such as screen reading software or an electronic braille display, requires skills; the means to procure, purchase, and power the technology; and access to information in a compatible format. Compensatory skills learned in vision rehabilitation, such as orientation and mobility using a white cane, presupposes the necessary infrastructure of predictable paths and spaces in which the person can confidently move. These skills might be useful in one context but are not transferable to another—eg, in an urban setting with requisite infrastructure versus a rural setting without appropriate infrastructure. Clearly, much needs to be done to maximise the function and societal participation for people living with vision impairment. This is explored further in section 6.\nThe Commission calls for a more holistic approach to the health of people with vision impairment, who might have great difficulties with other health conditions and some might be perceived to no longer require eye care services.81, 82 We see integrated people-centred eye care as an opportunity to ensure that any reorientation of care promotes the rights of people to access eye care that they require during the life course, which is not limited to the condition causing their vision loss.\nAssessment of quality of life describes an overall state of wellbeing from the individual's perspective. Health-related quality of life describes the degree to which health affects wellbeing, whereas vision-related quality of life reflects the degree to which vision affects wellbeing.83, 84 Health-related quality of life and vision-related quality of life are used to understand how vision impairment affects wellbeing from a person-centred perspective, and how this perspective is influenced by personal, social, and environmental contexts.\nTo summarise the extensive research on the impact of vision impairment, eye conditions, and ophthalmic interventions on the quality of life, we conducted an umbrella review of systematic reviews (appendix 1 p 17).85 In total, 69 systematic reviews were identified. Nine of those reviews evaluated the relationship between quality of life and vision impairment or specific eye conditions, such as age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, or diabetic retinopathy, and all concluded that vision loss and eye disease were associated with poor quality of life outcomes. The remaining 60 reviews evaluated quality of life between groups receiving alternative ophthalmic interventions, active treatment (appendix 1 p 18), and controls who did not receive an ophthalmic intervention. 75% of ophthalmic interventions showed a positive impact on quality of life. Most notably, cataract surgery and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatment for age-related macular degeneration, diabetic macular oedema, and macular oedema secondary to other causes resulted in improved quality of life (appendix 1 p 18).\nOur umbrella review reinforces the close relationship between good vision and enhanced quality of life and provides a strong argument for increased investment in eye health. The umbrella review also highlights that despite quality of life being commonly assessed in ophthalmic studies, definitions varied widely. This Commission calls for the development and the adoption of standardised and culturally sensitive measures of quality of life for eye health research, to better understand the effect of vision impairment and ophthalmic interventions from the patient's perspective.\nPeople with self-reported vision impairment have increased risk of some health conditions such as depression, dementia, cardiovascular disease, and lung cancer.86, 87, 88, 89 The causal relationship between vision impairment and other conditions is complex, but can be broadly summarised by three different pathways (figure 5); (1) vision impairment causes or exacerbates other conditions either directly, through injuries, or indirectly—eg, through reduced access to health care, limitations in physical activity, or increased social isolation; (2) vision impairment and other conditions share common risk factors—eg, smoking, poverty, reduced health-care access, ageing, or poor diet; and (3) systemic health problems can lead to vision impairment—eg, diabetes and diabetic retinopathy, cancer and ocular metastases, and dementia—limiting access to eye health services.\nMore than one pathway seems to underlie the association between vision impairment and other health conditions, making the pathways difficult to elucidate. Here, we summarise a rapid review led by one of the commissioners to investigate the relationship between vision impairment and mental health; and cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and cancer (appendix 1 p 19).\nThe rapid review found that vision impairment is likely to be linked to depressive illness. A meta-analysis of data from high-income and middle-income countries found that 25% of people with eye conditions also have pronounced depressive symptoms.87 Depressive symptoms have been shown to increase with more severe eye disease.90, 91 Another meta-analysis found a significant reduction in depression after cataract surgery.92 A review done by members of this Commission, in addition to the rapid review, found an association between vision impairment and dementia, and suggested that interventions to improve vision could possibly slow down cognitive decline (panel 1).Panel 1Vision impairment and dementiaIn 2016, 43·8 million adults aged 60 years and older had dementia, with numbers doubling every 20 years (GBD Dementia Collaborators, 2019; Prince et al, 2013). The estimated global economic cost of dementia in 2018 was US$1 trillion (Wimo et al, 2017). Although there are few effective treatments (Mukaden et al, 2019), in the past decade vision impairment has emerged as a potential modifiable risk factor (Ehrlich et al, 2019; Swenor et al, 2019; Zheng et al, 2018; Brenowitz et al, 2019; Fischer et al, 2016; Schubert et al, 2017; Rogers et al, 2010; Nael et al, 2019; Maharani et al, 2018).Longitudinal studies indicate that vision impairment might be a risk factor for dementia and accelerated cognitive decline (Swenor et al, 2019; Zheng et al, 2018; Fischer et al, 2016; Rogers et al, 2010; Tran et al, 2020). In Singapore, adults with vision impairment had an accelerated cognitive decline (Lim et al, 2020). In the USA, vision impairment was associated with 55% increased hazard of incident cognitive impairment and the effect of declining vision on future declines in Mini-Mental State Exam scores was significantly stronger than the reverse association (Swenor et al, 2019). Among more than 1000 women in the USA, incident dementia increased with vision impairment severity (Tran et al, 2020). In France, near vision impairment was associated with increased dementia risk at 4 years, although this association waned with longer follow-up (Nael et al, 2019). Preliminary data suggest that cataract surgery might decrease risk of cognitive decline. In an English longitudinal study of ageing, cognitive decline slowed down significantly (by 50%) following cataract surgery (Maharani et al, 2018). Together, these data provide strong evidence of an association between vision impairment and dementia.Most research on vision impairment with cognitive function and dementia has been done in high-income countries, with few ongoing studies from LMICs (Lee et al, 2019; Kowal et al, 2012). However, there is a pressing need in all settings to test causal pathways that might underlie the association of vision impairment with cognitive decline and dementia. Although several hypotheses have been proposed to account for this relationship (Whitson et al, 2018), none have been rigorously tested. The postulated reason that dementia might be more prevalent in those with poor vision could be because of a single common underlying cause, such as neurodegenerative or microvascular disease. This reason is supported by the possible use of retinal imaging as a biomarker for dementia (Chan et al, 2019). Several indirect pathways have also been proposed. Poor vision is known to increase cognitive load (Pigeon et al, 2019), a stressor that might increase dementia risk. Another possibility is that decreased visual input could result in direct alteration of brain structure. Finally, vision impairment might exert its effect on dementia risk by limiting social and physical activity, factors that have separately been shown to elevate dementia risk (Tan et al, 2017; Reas et al, 2019; Rafnsson et al, 2020).Vision impairment is possibly a modifiable risk factor for dementia because most of vision loss is preventable or treatable. However, vision impairment has not been widely recognised as such outside of the vision research community (Livingstone et al, 2020). Additional work is needed to ensure that various stakeholders invest in the importance of characterising cognitive trajectories of older adults with vision and multisensory impairments and in the testing of interventions to slow cognitive decline across diverse cultural and geographic contexts. References for this panel can be found in appendix 1 (p 105).\nIndirect pathways might also link vision impairment with systemic conditions—eg, as a barrier to accessing health care. A UK study93 found that women with vision impairment were less likely to participate in breast and bowel cancer screening than women with no disabilities, after adjusting for confounding factors. Reduced physical activity might be another important factor; older adults in the USA with vision impairment took 26% fewer steps each day and spent 48% less time in moderate or vigorous physical activity than those with healthy vision.94, 95 Reduced physical activity is a leading risk factor for non-communicable eye diseases.\nOcular and general health conditions might share common risk factors. Smoking is associated with lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, coronary artery disease, dementia, and numerous eye conditions including cataract, age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and possibly glaucoma.96, 97, 98, 99 Sun exposure is associated with cataract and skin cancer.100 Poor diet, obesity, and low physical activity are common to systemic diseases and eye diseases. Consumption of vegetables, fruit, and micronutrients are protective for some cancers, cardiovascular disease, and depression. Similarly, a Mediterranean diet and some micronutrients might protect against cardiovascular disease and cataract, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration.97, 101, 102, 103\nFor cases in which systemic diseases directly cause vision impairment, the pathophysiology is often better understood. However, causative effects of general illness on vision impairment can also be mediated indirectly through the reverse of some of the indirect pathways. For example, poor systemic health might limit physical activity, which might increase risk of diabetic retinopathy104 and glaucoma progression.105 Preventive initiatives that reduce smoking, improve diet, and promote physical activity are likely to have shared benefits for general and ocular health. The question of whether interventions to ameliorate vision impairment can also improve general health is an important area for future investigation.\nIn a similar way to vision impairment, hearing impairment is also associated with age. Therefore, dual sensory impairment—ie, when these two conditions occur concurrently—is an important consideration for healthy ageing.106 This Commission did a scoping review to summarise dual sensory impairment definitions, prevalence, and the effect on people's lives (appendix 1 p 21). We found striking heterogeneity in the definitions of dual sensory impairment (67 variations in 151 studies), the age groups included, and prevalence estimates. Despite this heterogeneity, dual sensory impairment appears prevalent in older adults (increasing prevalence with age), and many studies reported that people with dual sensory impairment had worse physical and psychosocial health outcomes and reduced social participation compared with those who had only vision impairment or hearing impairment. In the context of an ageing population, this Commission calls for greater emphasis on dual sensory impairment, including a consensus on definitions and reporting, and collaborative efforts to advance the research, clinical care, and social inclusion for this population.\nDriving is a complex vision-dependent task with a risk of road traffic injury. SDG3 (good health and wellbeing) and SDG11 (improving the sustainability of cities and communities) include targets to reduce road traffic injury, which is the leading cause of death for children and young adults.107 This Commission did a systematic review of the relationship between vision impairment and driving, outlined in appendix 1 (pp 22–23). Findings from 115 studies showed that some causes of vision impairment, such as glaucoma and cataract, are associated with motor vehicle collisions and unsafe driving practices.108, 109 Interventions such as cataract surgery can reduce the risk of motor vehicle collisions,56, 110 whereas anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (for age-related macular degeneration or diabetic macular oedema) can enable continued participation in driving.111, 112 Most of these data were from high-income countries (88%). With the increasing reliance on motor vehicle transport, maintaining vision is essential for drivers to prevent road traffic injuries and promote independent mobility. This Commission calls for ready access to eye care services for drivers and evidence-based legislation to mitigate the risks associated with vision impairment and driving, particularly in LMICs.\nGlobally, a third of people aged over 65 years fall each year and falls are the leading cause of injury-related death among adults over 70 years.113, 114 This Commission did a systematic review to assess the relationship between vision impairment, ophthalmic interventions, and falls (appendix 1 pp 23–24). The main findings from 129 studies showed that vision impairment is an independent risk factor for falls among older adults and that timely access to ophthalmic interventions such as cataract surgery can reduce the risk of falls.115, 116, 117 On the basis of these findings, we call for vision to be included in risk assessment tools for falls and for eye care services to be better integrated with fall prevention efforts.\nVision impairment seems to be associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality.118, 119, 120, 121 Several explanations are possible for this association in relation to non-communicable eye diseases, mental health, and injuries (figure 5). This Commission did a systematic review and meta-analysis to contribute an updated appraisal of the literature, assessment of bias, and overall grading of the quality of evidence (appendix 1 p 24).122 We included studies that measured visual acuity and contained at least 1-year follow-up to assess all-cause mortality. A total of 28 studies representing 30 cohorts were included. Studies came from 12 countries in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America and included 451 001 participants.\nThe primary meta-analysis included studies comparing mortality among participants with vision better or worse than the prespecified thresholds of 6/12, 6/18, and 6/60. Since age is a common risk factor for vision impairment and mortality, all measures of association in this meta-analysis were age-adjusted. Where available, we also selected estimates adjusted for other possible confounders such as smoking, diabetes, access to health care, and socioeconomic status. Figure 6 presents the results of this analysis. We found that the hazard of mortality was higher among those with visual acuity <6/12 (hazard ratio [HR] 1·29, 95% CI 1·20–1·39) and <6/18 (1·43, 1·22–1·68) compared to those with better vision. At the 6/60 threshold, the hazard of mortality was higher than for those with visual acuity of ≥6/18 (1·89, 1·45–2·47). However, no significant association was detected when comparing those with visual acuity better and worse than 6/60 (1·02, 0·79–1·32), probably because the reference group contained participants with a substantial degree of vision impairment (≥6/60). We evaluated the certainty of evidence using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework and judged it to be of moderate certainty.123 Additional research is needed to better understand factors that modulate mortality risk among adults with vision impairment, and to more fully characterise risk in LMICs, where data remain scarce. Given the prevailing finding of an association between vision impairment and mortality, future calculations of disability-adjusted life-years might include years of life lost due to vision impairment, which could provide a more complete estimate of the overall global burden of vision impairment. The impact of vision impairment on mortality should drive action to address avoidable sight loss and reinforces the relevance of eye health to SDG3 (good health and wellbeing) and the SDGs in general.\nWorld Health Assembly Resolution 66/11 Universal eye health: a global action plan 2014–19, opened up a new opportunity for WHO member states to progress with their efforts to prevent vision impairment and strengthen vision loss rehabilitation in their countries.124 Central to this process is an understanding of the prevalence, magnitude, and causes of vision loss.\nThe Vision Loss Expert Group (VLEG) has worked with the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) collaborators since 2007 to produce global vision loss metrics. The VLEG published global estimates for vision loss and modelled temporal change for the first time in 2010,125, 126 and subsequently in 2015.127, 128 The results from 2015 were also published in the World report on vision by WHO.2 These analyses use definitions from the ICD-11 for distance and near vision impairment. The VLEG–GBD group collaborators have jointly published estimates for 2020, which we summarised here.1\nGlobally, of 7·79 billion people living in 2020, it is estimated that 43·28 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 37·57–48·36) are blind with presenting visual acuity of worse than 3/60 in the better eye and a crude all-age prevalence of 0·55% (0·48–0·61; table 3). Of these, 55% or 23·88 million (20·83–26·82) are women. The prevalence of blindness increases with age; most (77·7% or 33·61 million, 28·58–38·54) people with blindness are aged 50 years or older.\nModerate or severe vision impairment (MSVI) is defined as presenting visual acuity of worse than 6/18 to 3/60 in the better eye. MSVI is estimated to affect 295·09 million (95% UI 267·32–324·60) people, which is 3·74% (3·39–4·12) of the global population (table 3). A further 257·83 million (232·66–285·34) or 3·27% (2·95–3·62) have mild vision impairment, defined as presenting visual acuity of worse than 6/12 to 6/18 in the better eye. Globally, an estimated 509·69 million (371·11–666·66) people globally have near vision impairment from uncorrected presbyopia, representing 22·06% (15·52–29·62) of people aged 50 years and older. Similar to the gender imbalance in blindness, 55% or 162·97 million (147·43–179·21) of individuals who have MSVI and 55% or 142·29 million (128·45–157·36) of people with mild vision impairment are women.\nGlobally, 91·75% of people who are blind (39·62 million, 95% UI 34·64–44·79) and 87·68% of those with MSVI (257·90 million, 231·87–285·81) live in LMICs. There are large interregional differences in crude and age-standardised prevalence of blindness and MSVI for 2020 (figure 7; appendix 1 p 26). Western sub-Saharan Africa has the highest age-standardised prevalence of blindness (1·11%, 0·95–1·26) and high-income North America has the lowest prevalence (0·12%, 0·11–0·14). South Asia has the highest age-standardised overall prevalence of MSVI (6·44%, 5·79–7·13). The largest number of blind people live in South Asia (11·9 million, 10·4–13·4), followed by east Asia (9·1 million, 7·9–10·3), and southeast Asia (5·9 million, 5·2–6·7), because of the large regional populations (figure 7; appendix 1 p 26). MSVI follows a similar pattern.\nThe World report on vision2 by WHO used estimates of people with distance vision impairment for 2015, provided by the VLEG, and combined these with an estimated 1·8 billion people with addressed (974 million) and unaddressed (826 million) near vision impairment due to presbyopia, derived from a different model, to reach an overall figure of 2·2 billion people with vision impairment.127, 128, 129 These 2015 estimates have now been superseded by 2020 estimates from the VLEG–GBD group.\nIn summary, for 2020, there are an estimated 596 million people with distance vision impairment and a further 510 million with uncorrected presbyopia. These estimates do not include people who have already received spectacles or contact lenses to correct distance refractive error or presbyopia, because reliable population-based data are scarce. However, this group probably represents a very large number of people who require ongoing services to meet their eye health needs.129, 130\nThe leading causes of blindness globally are cataract (17·01 million, 95% UI 14·40–19·93), uncorrected refractive error (3·70 million, 3·10–4·29), glaucoma (3·61 million, 2·81–4·42), age-related macular degeneration (1·85 million, 1·35–2·43), and diabetic retinopathy (1·07 million, 0·76–1·51; appendix 1 p 27).131 Notably, 37% (16·04 million, 14·00–18·06) of all blindness is attributable to a variety of other conditions. This group cannot be overlooked when focusing on the five leading causes of blindness. A person can have more than one cause of vision impairment; however, epidemiological studies tend to report only the primary cause.\nIn 2020, the leading causes of MSVI globally are uncorrected refractive error (157·49 million, 140·30–175·54), followed by cataract (83·48 million, 71·76–95·98), age-related macular degeneration (6·23 million, 5·04–7·59), glaucoma (4·14 million, 3·24–5·18), and diabetic retinopathy (3·28 million, 2·41–4·34; appendix 1 p 28).1\nRegions with particularly high prevalence of cataract blindness (as a proportion of all-cause blindness) include south Asia, Oceania, and southeast Asia, where cataract is responsible for around half of all blindness in 2020 (figure 8).131 In high-income regions, glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration account for a greater proportion of blindness than other regions. In all regions, uncorrected refractive error is responsible for most MSVI. In 2020, 77·3% of people with blindness and MSVI have an avoidable cause, defined as cataract or uncorrected refractive error; increasing to 90·9% if near vision impairment is included.\nData on vision impairment in children and adults younger than 40 years are scarce. Surveys need to be larger because blindness prevalence is lower in this age group (3 per 10 000 children in high-income countries, 10 per 10 000 in low-income countries) and some conditions appear as clusters. Measuring visual acuity of young children is challenging. As a result, population-based data are rare and mostly consist of school surveys. Mindful of these data limitations, the VLEG–GBD group has estimated that for 2020, 1·44 million children aged 0–14 years are blind (including uncorrected refractive error), 22·16 million have MSVI, and 46·60 million have mild vision impairment.\nIn 1990, WHO estimated that 1·5 million children (aged 0–15 years) worldwide were blind, excluding those with refractive errors.132 In 1999, WHO updated this estimate using an alternative method based on under-5 mortality rate as a proxy indicator for prevalence of blindness in children aged 0–15 years; reporting 1·4 million children.133 The rationale was that many causes of blindness in children also cause mortality, such as measles infection, vitamin A deficiency, meningitis, malaria, birth hypoxia, and prematurity. This prevalence was re-estimated at 1·14 million for 2015.134 Using the same method, this Commission re-estimated prevalence of blindness to be 1·02 million for 2020; representing a global prevalence of 4·8 per 10 000 children (appendix 1 pp 29–31). Further decline reflects a fall in under-5 mortality rate and stabilisation of the global population of children at 2·1 billion. South Asia and Western sub-Saharan Africa account for almost half (45·6%) of all children who are blind (appendix 1 p 30).\nOverall, these two different estimation approaches have produced similar values. However, there is a pressing need for new methods to obtain more extensive survey data that would be representative of the population and would improve the estimates of vision impairment in children.\nTo model temporal trends, the VLEG–GBD group1 generated forecasts of vision impairment prevalence for 1990–2019 (in 5-year increments), using age-specific prevalence as input into a regression model with year, region, and age as predictors. In the past 30 years, age-standardised prevalence of blindness has reduced by approximately 28·5%. By 2050, the number of people who are blind is predicted to increase to 61·05 million globally (95% UI 52·85–69·27). For MSVI, the number affected is expected to rise to 474·12 million (428·43–518·23), followed by 360·35 million (321·96–399·96) for mild vision impairment, and 865·67 million (628·79–1154·14) for vision impairment from uncorrected presbyopia (figure 9).\nThese trends are continuing—largely driven by population ageing and changes in disease patterns. UN projections135 indicate a substantial increase in the number of people aged 65 years and older over the next 30 years, from 700 million to 1·5 billion, with the largest increase in LMICs. Many conditions causing vision impairment become more prevalent with age.\nProjections suggest that the proportion of people with vision loss who are women will increase (figure 9).1 When actual numbers are assessed, there are more women than men living with blindness and MSVI in all regions of the world (figure 10). This gender imbalance can be attributed to demographic factors (women living longer than men) and social factors (women having reduced access to care). To adjust for demographic differences, age-standardised prevalence can be compared to provide a better estimate of gender inequity. Even after this adjustment, MSVI prevalence is higher in women in all regions of the world (except in two regions: central and southern sub-Saharan Africa; appendix 1 p 32). Men have lower age-standardised prevalence of blindness in less than half of world regions. Globally, for every 100 men with blindness or MSVI there are 108 women with blindness and 112 women with MSVI. The persistent gender differences after age-standardisation suggest that, in some settings, greater vision loss in women is socially determined. Some groups of women have difficulty accessing eye care, particularly in southeast Asia. These demographic and social factors have major implications for the pursuit of gender equity within universal health coverage.\nThere are several important risk factor and disease-specific trends that are changing the epidemiology of eye disease in many populations (panel 2). In the past three decades there has been substantial success in controlling trachoma and onchocerciasis. Environmental factors and educational practices, particularly in Asian populations, are believed to explain the pronounced increase in myopia in schoolchildren and young adults. Increasing urbanisation, less active lifestyles, and altered diets are contributing to a marked increase in diabetes, resulting in more people affected by diabetic retinopathy (appendix 1 p 33). Myopia and diabetic retinopathy require specific prevention and management strategies. New treatments for wet age-related macular degeneration have reduced the progression to blindness from this cause.Panel 2The changing epidemiology of eye diseaseChanging epidemiology of eye diseaseReferences for this panel can be found in appendix 1 (pp 106–08).Global increase of myopiaMyopia is a major growing public health challenge. More than 2 billion people worldwide have a degree of myopia (≥–0·5 dioptres), 15% of whom have high myopia (≥–5 dioptres; Holden et al, 2016; WHO, 2015). In 2020, an estimated 161 million people worldwide were blind or had moderate to severe vision impairment from uncorrected refractive error, the leading cause of vision impairment (Bourne et al, 2020). By 2050, myopia is expected to affect 5 billion people, more than half of the projected global population (Holden et al, 2016), which will place an enormous burden on health services to provide spectacles and detect and manage serious eye diseases caused by high myopia (appendix 1 p 34). Uncorrected myopia and myopic macular degeneration, a major complication of high myopia, were responsible for approximately US$250 billion lost global productivity in 2015 (Naidoo et al, 2019).Myopia is rapidly increasing worldwide (Holden et al, 2016; Naidoo et al, 2019; Koh et al, 2014; Vitale et al, 2008; Morgan et al, 2019). Myopia is considered a genetic condition with more than 200 associated genes, individually and in combination these genes contribute to only a small proportion of myopia (Tedja et al, 2019). Furthermore, the rapid global increase in school myopia cannot be explained by genetics alone, given the prevalence rise in a short timeframe (Morgan et al, 2019). Environmental factors and gene–environment interactions are thought to play a large role.The large increase in myopia prevalence in east and southeast Asia since 1960 have mirrored rapid economic development and the associated educational and lifestyle changes in societies such as Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and South Korea (Siddiqi et al, 2001). The prevalence of myopia in people aged 20 years has risen from 20–30% in the mid-20th century to more than 80% nowadays (Morgan et al, 2019). China has also shown a rapid increase in myopia in the past few decades (Morgan et al, 2019; Sun et al, 2015). High myopia is becoming more prevalent and developing at a younger age (WHO, 2015), resulting in increased vision impairment and blindness from its complications (myopic macular degeneration, retinal detachment, and glaucoma; Liu et al, 2020; Fricke et al, 2018).Educational pressures are substantially higher in east and southeast Asia than in other world regions (Morgan et al, 2019), which creates two interrelated environmental risk factors for myopia: a combination of increased near work activity (including screen time with increasing use of smart devices) and reduced outdoor activity (Dirani et al, 2019). With long periods of near work (Huang et al, 2015), children from east and southeast Asia spend less time outdoors than their peers in countries such as Australia (Rose et al, 2016; Wen et al, 2020). Clinical trials of increased time outdoors report a 25–50% reduction in incident myopia, although the precise mechanisms for these effects are not yet understood (Wu et al, 2018).Finally, optical interventions such as spectacles and contact lenses reduce retinal defocus and slow myopia progression (Wildsoet et al, 2019). Pharmacological therapies such as low-dose atropine, have also been shown to slow myopia progression, although the underlying mechanism is unclear (Wildsoet et al, 2019; Walline et al, 2020). There are no good treatment options for myopic macular degeneration, although the treatment of one of its major complications, myopic choroidal neovascularisation, has improved with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy (Cheung et al, 2017).Reducing the growing societal burdens of uncorrected myopia will require complex strategies—ie, combining prevention methods with enhanced capacity to deliver high quality, affordable, and equitable refractive services (Ang et al, 2020). Investments will be substantial but are likely to be outweighed by the cost of inaction.Diabetic retinopathyDiabetic retinopathy is the most common microvascular complication of diabetes (Wong et al, 2016). The global prevalence of diabetes has tripled in the past 20 years. In 2019, diabetes prevalence was estimated at 9·3% (95% CI 7·4–12·1) of the global population aged 20–79 years, which is 463 million people, and is projected to reach 700 million by 2045 (Saeedi et al, 2019). The increase, mainly in type 2 diabetes, is attributed to dietary and lifestyle changes related to urbanisation, population growth, and increasing life expectancy (Saeedi et al, 2019; WHO, 2016). There are large regional differences in age-standardised prevalence of diabetes, with the highest in north Africa and the Middle East (12·2%, 8·3–16·1) and the lowest in sub-Saharan Africa (4·7%, 3·2–8·1). The greatest number of people with diabetes are in China, India, and the USA (Saeedi et al, 2019). In the next 25 years, sub-Saharan Africa is projected to have the largest percentage increase in diabetes (appendix 1 p 33). People with diabetes in LMICs are predominantly younger than 65 years and face a large unmet need for diabetes treatment, leading to inadequate glycaemic control and subsequent complications of diabetes (Manne-Goehler et al, 2019).As the global prevalence of diabetes increases, the prevalence of vision loss from diabetic retinopathy will also increase. Although the crude prevalence of other causes of blindness decreased between 1990 and 2020, diabetic retinopathy-related blindness increased by 68%, mainly in LMICs (Flaxman et al, 2017; Leasher et al, 2016). A meta-analysis of population-based studies estimated that globally 34·6% (34·5–34·8) of people with diabetes have some degree of diabetic retinopathy and 10·2% (10·1–10·3) have vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy (Yau et al, 2012). Some findings show that the risk of developing diabetic retinopathy varies between populations although these data are scarce (Yau et al, 2012). Multiplying the estimated number of people with diabetes (Saeedi et al, 2019) by the global diabetic retinopathy prevalence provides an estimate of the magnitude of these conditions (Yau et al, 2012). In 2019, an estimated 160 million people had some form of diabetic retinopathy, of whom 47 million had vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy; by 2045 this number is projected to increase to 242 million (for diabetic retinopathy) and 71 million (for vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy; appendix 1 p 33).In northern USA with good access to care, cumulative lifetime incidence of diabetic retinopathy for a person with type 1 diabetes was estimated at 90% in 1984 and for type 2 diabetes, approximately 50% (Klein et al, 1984 and 1984). The risk seems to be decreasing over time, particularly in high-income countries, probably because of improved risk factor control and advances in diagnostics over the past 30 years (Sabanayagam et al, 2019 and 2016).Several factors influence the risk of developing diabetic retinopathy. Glycaemic control is a key factor, particularly in type 1 diabetes, and improved glycaemic control reduces the incident risk of diabetic retinopathy, progression, and sight loss (Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Research Group, 1993; UK Prospective Diabetes Study [UKPDS] Group, 1998). Increasing duration of diabetes is another major determinant for diabetic retinopathy, with incident risk rising to more than 75% in those living with diabetes for more than 15 years (Klein et al, 1984 and 1984). Hypertension is the third risk factor and might be more important in people with type 2 diabetes. Tight blood pressure control is thought to prevent the development of diabetic retinopathy, although its effect on diabetic retinopathy progression is less clear (UKPDS, 1998; Do et al, 2015). There appears to be genetic variation in diabetic retinopathy susceptibility, particularly among people with type 1 diabetes (Arar et al, 2008; Huang et al, 2011). Epigenetic factors might also be important in the pathophysiology (Kowluru et al, 2015).Early detection and timely treatment of vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy can prevent 95% of blindness from this cause (Vujosevic et al, 2020). Strong links between general medical services and eye care are needed to ensure effective well-coordinated care. Treatment of vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy includes laser photocoagulation for retinopathy and maculopathy and careful consideration of an intravitreal injection with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (Wong et al, 2018). Diabetic retinopathy screening and treatment programmes are considered by WHO as other recommended effective interventions in health care for non-communicable diseases (WHO, 2017). Low resources in many low-income and middle-income countries, to implement screening programmes and current cost-effectiveness ratios (outside the <$100 per disability-adjusted life-year range), means that reducing costs and increasing efficiency (through targeted screening, decreasing cost of treatment, and increasing completion rates) should be a high priority (Poore et al, 2015; Burgess et al, 2013). Additionally, a high proportion of people with diabetes are undiagnosed, with marked inequity seen within populations. In high-income countries, populations from disadvantaged groups (eg, highly deprived, ethnic minorities, and Indigenous people) are unable to equitably access services, leading to differential outcomes (Denniston et al, 2019; Foreman et al, 2017). New technologies, including teleophthalmology and artificial intelligence, offer potential new solutions (Vujosevic et al, 2020).Successful disease control programmesOnchocerciasis control effortsOnchocerciasis, also known as river blindness, is a neglected tropical disease resulting in parasitic filarial infection caused by Onchocerca volvulus, which is transmitted by the Simulium blackfly. After an infected blackfly bite, adult worms (macrofilariae) develop in nodules under the skin. These worms release large numbers of microfilariae, which disperse around the body. The Global Burden of Disease study (Disease and Injury Incidence and Prevalence Collaborators, 2018) estimated that onchocerciasis infected 20·9 million people worldwide and caused vision loss in 1·15 million people from inflammatory damage to the cornea, retina, and optic nerve. The Simulium blackfly requires fast-flowing well-oxygenated water for its lifecycle, so larvicide treatment of fly breeding sites can interrupt transmission. Ivermectin can reduce symptoms and break transmission by killing microfilariae and stopping their release from adult female worms.During the past five decades, four regionally focused control programmes have been developed. The Onchocerciasis Control Programme between 1974 and 2002, was launched by the World Bank, WHO, UNDP, and the Food and Agriculture Organization to control onchocerciasis transmission by larvicide spraying of rivers in seven (later expanded to 11) west African countries. The African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control between 1994 and 2015 was launched by the World Bank and WHO in 19 (other) African endemic countries and to assist the original 11 countries, using community directed treatment with ivermectin to control (and later eliminate) the disease. The Onchocerciasis Elimination Programme for the Americas was launched by WHO in 1992 to eliminate transmission of onchocerciasis in six endemic countries in central and south America using twice a year distribution of ivermectin. The Expanded Special Project for the Elimination of Neglected Tropical Diseases was established in 2016 by WHO Regional Office for Africa, member states, and neglected tropical disease partners to mobilise political, technical, and financial resources to accelerate the elimination of the five most prevalent neglected tropical diseases.These programmes led to several key achievements. Infection has been prevented or treated and vision loss was prevented in more than 80 million people in 27 African countries and six countries of the Americas. Transmission of O volvulus has been eliminated in four of six endemic countries in the Americas and some areas in Africa. Programmes have supported health system capacity building for control of neglected tropical diseases. Arable land in Africa has been reclaimed for agriculture and economic development (WHO, 2008).A key component of success of the African programme was implementation research, which identified that community-directed drug administration was an effective delivery strategy for ivermectin. A further benefit was the provision of extensive capacity building opportunities for African researchers, who are now global leaders in their field.Lessons from onchocerciasis controlEconomic impact research and advocacy led to the donation of ivermectin by Merck in 1988—“as much as is needed for as long as it is needed”. This donation was crucial in creating an international public–private partnership to improve the health of affected communities.Regional programmes enabled efficient use of technical resources and cross-border treatment of endemic communities.The community-directed distribution of ivermectin increased coverage, while keeping the cost of distribution low and improving coverage and sustainability.The partnership between endemic communities, ministries of health, UN agencies, international and local non-governmental organisations, agricultural agencies, and the pharmaceutical industry has become a model for control of onchocerciasis and other neglected tropical diseases.Implementation research built into these programmes to address issues of disease transmission, resistance, coverage, cost-effectiveness, adverse effects, and disability, has been crucial to their successful implementation (WHO, 2008).Eliminating trachoma as a public health problemTrachoma is the leading infectious cause of blindness, recognised as a clinical entity for many years, and responsible for vision impairment or blindness in 1·9 million people (Bourne et al, 2013). The pathogen, Chlamydia trachomatis, was first isolated in China in 1955 (Tang et al, 1957). The discovery that one oral dose of the antibiotic <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightorange; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">azithromycin<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">chemical</span>\n</mark> was effective <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightgreen; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">against<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">usages</span>\n</mark> C trachomatis reinvigorated efforts to control and eliminate the disease (Bailey et al, 1993). The WHO Alliance for the Global Elimination of Trachoma by 2020 was established in 1996 (WHO, 1997). Elimination of blindness from trachoma was included in VISION 2020 (WHO, 2000 and 2003). Since then, as a result of a well-coordinated effort between health ministries, donors, and implementing partners, the number of people at risk of blindness from trachoma has decreased by 91% from an estimated 1·5 billion in 2002 to under 137 million in 2020, and the number of people requiring surgery for trichiasis has decreased by 74% from 7·6 million in 2002 to 2 million in 2020 (WHO, 2020). Nine countries have been validated by WHO as having eliminated trachoma as a public health problem (WHO, 2020). Many other disease communities have monitored the trachoma community.Four crucial factors might underlie successFirst, normative guidance from WHO translated into preferred practices by the International Coalition for Trachoma Control, based on the SAFE strategy (surgery for trichiasis, antibiotic treatment, facial cleanliness, and environmental improvement).The SAFE strategy was formally adopted by WHO member states in 1998 in the World Health Assembly Resolution 51.11 (WHO, 1998). Conclusions and recommendations from the annual meeting of the Alliance for the Global Elimination of Trachoma are translated into complementary action plans by health ministries, academics, donors, and implementing partners.Second, partnerships fostered within the Alliance for the Global Elimination of Trachoma and International Coalition for Trachoma Control, supporting government-led implementation of the SAFE strategy in endemic countries. Partners come together to strengthen national capacity; to coordinate the efforts of governments with those of funders, implementing partners, and researchers; and to mobilise resources from various donors to fill gaps in the global programme (Courtright et al, 2018).Third, committed donors and a data-driven medicine donation programme with a strong country-led accountability framework. Pfizer's commitment to supply <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightorange; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">azithromycin<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">chemical</span>\n</mark> for trachoma elimination is coupled with robust stewardship of the donation by the International Trachoma Initiative. Many other committed and motivated donors also support these programmes.Fourth, credible national plans to achieve elimination. Through trachoma action plans and neglected tropical disease plans, health ministries have crafted ambitious but attainable targets, facilitating the political decision making that underlies progress in public health. Crucial decisions include commitments to scale up interventions, standardise approaches, allocate domestic resources, and recruit new stakeholders.Now, in the last mile of trachoma elimination, the trachoma community has built on its strong foundations and strengthened global collaboration with four key enabling factors.(1)A shared passion and ambition to target gaps and achieve a world free of trachoma.(2)Use of high-quality prevalence data generated by the Global Trachoma Mapping Project and Tropical Data, coupled with rigorous research overseen by the WHO Network of Collaborating Centres for Trachoma to underpin evidence for interventions and facilitate refinement in programme delivery (Solomon et al, 2015 and 2018; WHO, 2017).(3)Innovation for continuous improvement and accelerating the global programme, including new tools for active trachoma diagnosis and trichiasis surgeon training and practice (Solomon et al, 2018; Gower et al, 2014; Merbs et al, 2012); open online courses for programme managers (London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, 2020); streamlining of reporting for endemic countries through the Trachoma Elimination Monitoring Form jointly managed by WHO and the International Trachoma Initiative; and transparent updates about the progress of antibiotic shipments through the International Trachoma Initiative <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightorange; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">azithromycin<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">chemical</span>\n</mark> tracker.(4)Integration by pursuing mutually advantageous opportunities to engage with interdependent sectors (water, sanitation, and hygiene, education, vision, and neglected tropical diseases).WHO noted in an analysis of progress towards trachoma elimination, the 2021–30 Neglected Tropical Disease Roadmap, that key components (technical progress, strategy, service delivery) were in place, with enabling factors producing amplification of collective efforts (WHO, 2020). The essential actions required to achieve global elimination of trachoma as a public health problem are: continued investment in implementation, additional research to better understand transmission and how to limit transmission in different settings, improvements in surgical quality, strengthening surveillance capacity to monitor possible recrudescence, and ongoing advocacy for domestic financing (Habtamu et al, 2016; Last et al, 2020). These actions for trachoma overlap substantially with recommendations for the vision sector in the WHO World report on vision, reminding communities that integrated people-centred eye care is a cornerstone to end trachoma.\nPopulation-based eye health surveys typically quantify vision impairment at an individual level. Surveys usually do not report conditions that have the potential to cause vision loss later in life, such as early glaucoma or diabetic retinopathy, or conditions that typically do not cause vision impairment. Surveys report data for the better seeing eye, overlooking individuals with monocular problems, which greatly underestimates the magnitude of eye conditions and service needs.\nBroadly there are three groups of people that need eye care services: the first group are people with manifest or corrected vision impairment who need ongoing care, including rehabilitative services; the second group are people with early stage disease or at high risk of eye conditions that might cause vision impairment in later life, who need ongoing care to prevent the disease or its progression; and the third group are people with symptomatic conditions that typically do not cause vision impairment but require services.\nThe first group is partly quantified in population-based surveys measuring vision loss and summarised by the 2020 VLEG–GBD data.1 There is also a large but poorly quantified group of people, mostly with corrected refractive error or presbyopia, who need ongoing intermittent eye checks. Recording uncorrected visual acuity, in addition to visual acuity, in future population-based surveys will help to quantify this group.2 Data on the younger age groups are particularly scarce.\nFor the second group, vision-impairment-based surveys and analyses underestimate common diseases because they do not report conditions in people without impaired vision.136, 137, 138 Using population-based comprehensive survey data, it has been estimated that 76 million people are living with glaucoma worldwide in 2020.136 However, the latest 2020 global estimates for blindness (3·61 million) and MSVI (4·13 million) attributed to glaucoma are substantially lower (appendix 1 pp 27–28). Although these estimates are derived using different approaches, clearly, most people with glaucoma are not included in GBD estimates because their central visual acuity is preserved. Glaucoma constricts the visual field and even mild forms cause problems with reading, walking, and increase the risk of falling. Most people living with glaucoma have not been diagnosed and are not receiving treatment.139\nIn 2020, 4·4 million people were estimated to be blind or have MSVI from diabetic retinopathy (appendix 1 pp 27–28). However, this number is small compared with the 160 million people who have any diabetic retinopathy, or the estimated 463 million people living with diabetes in 2019, all of whom require regular access to eye care services to reduce long-term risk of vision loss (appendix 1 p 33).138, 140 People with vision impairment represent only a small proportion of all people who need these services. The second group also includes high-risk populations that require screening services for early disease detection. For example, premature infants at risk of retinopathy or older (≥40 years) African Americans, at risk of glaucoma.\nThe third group includes conditions that rarely affect vision, such as conjunctivitis and dry eyes. Existing data suggest that the number of people affected are considerable. For example, a large UK database141 of 3 million people showed that ocular problems without vision impairment account for 88·1% of all general practitioner consultations related to eye health and 68·9% of referrals. Data from secondary eye units, which are part of the Aravind Eye Care System in India, show a similar pattern; only 41% had visual acuity of worse than 6/12 in the worse eye and 28% in the better eye (appendix 1 p 35). Similarly, data from a secondary eye unit in Kenya found that less than half of presentations were for conditions associated with vision impairment.6\nThe implications of these findings are important and require action. There is a need for standard terminology and robust definitions to measure the magnitude of eye disease that does not impair vision; data need to be collected and analysed to assess this magnitude; the impact of non-visually impairing eye disease on the quality of life and its economic consequences need to be assessed; and the full magnitude and impact of all eye disease needs to inform health-care planning to serve the population and improve eye health.\nPopulation-based surveys provide estimates of disease prevalence, service coverage, and outcomes. These data are needed to support service planning, resourcing, and monitoring, and can be aggregated to provide regional or global estimates.1, 127, 128, 131, 142 Broadly, there are two approaches to eye health surveys, comprehensive and rapid (appendix 1 pp 36–37). Comprehensive eye health surveys typically include an in-depth ophthalmic examination with imaging for independent retinal grading and data on risk factors. Several rapid assessment methods are available.143 The most used method is the Rapid Assessment of Avoidable Blindness (RAAB), for people aged 50 years and older. The most applicable approach balances the required epidemiological detail and the available resources.\nDeveloping reliable estimates of eye disease depends on good quality survey data. This Commission has analysed the distribution of surveys since 2000 (appendix 1 pp 38–42). Most were RAAB surveys. Some regions have scarce or old data (eg, western and central sub-Saharan Africa, central Asia, central Europe, North America; figure 11). Where there are few data for a region, modelling approaches are sometimes used to fill in the gaps.\nRapid and comprehensive techniques have predominantly reported presenting distance visual acuity (ie, with available correction). However, following the WHO World report on vision, future eye health surveys are strongly encouraged to measure uncorrected visual acuity as well, and acknowledge met and unmet need for refractive services in addition to presenting vision impairment prevalence.2 With new focus on effective refractive error coverage as a core indicator, accurate diagnosis of refractive error needs to be ensured. The accuracy of pinhole correction to identify uncorrected refractive error (a common survey approach), might be variable as opposed to subjective refraction, on account of the quality, the type of pinhole occluder used, or other pathology.144 Standardisation of procedures and equipment is required.\nThe World report on vision by WHO2 highlighted the need for greater methodological and reporting standardisation of eye health surveys. Although generic tools such as the Strengthening The Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) checklist and the risk of bias assessment exist, none are specific to eye health surveys,145 which is a missed opportunity to promote robust study design, reduce risk of bias, and emphasise complete reporting. In response, we did a two-round Delphi survey to identify key methodological issues and develop a checklist to improve the design, conduct, and reporting of vision impairment surveys, including minimising bias (appendix 1 p 43). Generic STROBE checklist items were endorsed as essential for high quality reporting in comprehensive and rapid surveys. We identified several STROBE items that were frequently poorly reported, several vision-specific extensions, and a need for better guidance to enhance the standardisation and quality of future eye health surveys (panel 3).Panel 3Key recommendations for improving population-based vision impairment surveysImproving survey design and conduct•Standardise equipment, participant recruitment strategy, and team training•Measure vision at a constant distance using a vision chart with high contrast, crowded, standardised optotypes•Assess quality assurance (survey staff accuracy of measuring vision) using Bland-Altman Limits of Agreement to test visual acuity or kappa, allowing to compare vision impairment categories•Address declining response rates globally by updating sample size calculations, sampling, and analytical approaches (eg, weighting by cluster non-response)•Incorporate standard socioeconomic position indices (eg, Equity Tool) and other known associated demographic or equity factors (eg, disability, distance from services)Improving completeness of reportingImprove application of Strengthening The Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) items•Item 6 (participant recruitment): report participant recruitment strategy in full•Item 12 and 16 (statistical methods): analyse and report crude and adjusted prevalence estimates with measures of uncertainty (eg, 95% CI), to account for the sampling design•Item 13 (results): report the number of units (eg, villages, households, people) sampled at each stage (assessed for eligibility, recruited, examined) with numbers of not contactable participants and reasons for non-participation•Item 14 (results): report missing data for each variable of interestExtensions of STROBE items for vision impairment surveys•Items 7 and 11 (variables): define and report vision categories and unit of analysis (eg, best eye or binocular), eye disease case definitions, avoidable vision loss, and any risk exposures of interest•Item 8 (details of measurement): for vision testing, report chart type (scale, optotype), approach to maintaining constant test distance, location of testing, and whether the examination protocol differed for different subgroups (eg, children or adults with cognitive impairment); if collecting clinical images, report details of reading centre personnel, training and grading or agreement criteriaMajor risks of bias to minimise and report•Wrong sample size bias—sample too small to yield precise prevalence estimates or too large and resource inefficient—eg, if expected prevalence of blindness is lower than sample prevalence•Selection bias—the sampled population not accurately representing the target population, resulting in erroneous inferences about the population's magnitude of vision impairment—eg, if the random sampling and enumeration procedures are not rigorously observed, a convenience sample might be recruited, yielding an apparently good response rate, who differ in important but unmeasurable ways from the true target population•Non-responder bias—non-responders might differ substantially from responders—eg, older people (in whom vision impairment is more prevalent) or people not working on account of vision impairment, are more likely to be available for examination than younger employed people•Diagnostic purity bias—narrow case definitions—eg, exclusion of ocular comorbidities might lead to misleading cause attribution, a tendency to over-report causes most easily identified from simple examination protocols and to underreport posterior segment disease•Missing clinical data bias—missing data might differentially impact reliability of results in different subgroups—eg, likelihood of agreeing to pupil dilation might vary between different clinical subgroups, affecting the ability to collect data\nHow important are blindness and vision loss to an individual, compared with other health morbidities? Disability weights (where 0 equals a state of full health and 1 equals death) and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) provide an answer. Nine studies (appendix 1 p 44), published between 1994 and 2015, used various approaches to estimate the disability weight associated with blindness, which ranged widely from 0·600 (in 1994) to 0·173 (in 2015).\nThere are multiple explanations for this variation.146 First, the construct being measured shifted over time from loss of wellbeing (disability) to loss of health. Second, studies described the impact on health states differently.147 Third, studies framed their questions differently. Fourth, some studies used expert panels exclusively from high-income countries, while others sought responses from large samples of the general public internationally. There are likely to be considerable regional differences in the impact of vision loss on quality of life. Finally, studies used different valuation methods, which included person trade-off, paired comparison, population health equivalence, and the visual analogue scale.\nThe GBD 2010 study disability weights sparked a lively debate.148, 149 By reporting a blindness disability weight reduction from 0·600 to 0·195, the apparent global importance of cataracts fell substantially.150, 151 WHO subsequently incorporated health state data to calculate another blindness disability weight of 0·338.152 In view of the wide range and major implications that this figure has on how vision loss is valued, further empirical research is urgently needed to understand societal valuations of vision impairment and reach a broad, evidence-based consensus of weights that should be applied, possibly allowing for the use of different weights in different settings.146\nWe searched the literature from Jan 1, 2000, to Dec 31, 2019, for partial economic studies (eg, cost of illness and economic burden of disease) and full economic studies (eg, cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit) reporting the economic cost of vision impairment or the cost of evaluating interventions for seven leading causes: cataract, refractive error, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, corneal opacity, and trachoma (appendix 1 pp 45–49).153 We excluded studies reporting only incremental costs, benefits, or cost-effectiveness ratios.\nIn total, 138 publications met these criteria, with scarce information about many regions and conditions. The geographical distribution and focus of each publication are shown in appendix 1 (p 48). We identified fourteen studies that reported global estimates related to eye health economics. Most (72%) regional estimates were from high-income countries. Study types were heterogeneous (appendix 1 p 49). The main economic study perspectives of vision impairment were societal (35%), health system (18%), or third-party payer (17%). Most studies (90%) used a prevalence-based approach for estimation.\nEconomic literature on eye health has multiple limitations and great uncertainty. First, many studies were not comprehensive in approach; most (70%) considered only one cost category (direct health-care costs, direct non-health-care costs, productivity loss, informal care, or intangible costs). Heterogeneity limits comparability and the few cost items included in many studies probably underestimate the full cost of treatment and rehabilitation. Second, vision impairment severity or disease stage are not standardised. Third, studies tended to be small and unrepresentative. Fourth, productivity loss estimates were limited in scope and generally made major, largely unsupported assumptions about the productivity and proportion of people with vision impairment who work. Finally, few studies did sensitivity analysis or addressed uncertainty. These limitations mean that previous estimates might have substantially underestimated or overestimated the economic impact of vision impairment, which limits the usefulness of cost-of-illness estimates and possibly led to flawed policy prioritisation decisions.\nWe have already explored the limitations that vision impairment can place on an individual's ability to engage in the workplace, ensuing loss of productivity and income. Addressing avoidable vision impairment and enabling people with permanent impairment to access and function well in the workplace, increases productivity. For example, a trial29 in India found that provision of near vision spectacles resulted in significantly increased productivity of people with presbyopia in harvesting tea (appendix 2 p 4).29\nOur systematic review identified 37 articles on productivity loss (appendix 1 p 49). Studies reported different combinations of components (absenteeism, presenteeism, wage reduction, reduction in employment, and premature mortality), although reduction in employment was the most frequently reported component. Assumptions around reduced employment attributable to vision impairment were variable, predominantly based on scarce data and diverse methods. Most studies focused on a single condition or a few regions. There are only three previous global productivity loss estimates for vision impairment and blindness, and they are compared in appendix 1 (p 50).154, 155, 156\nThis Commission has established a new estimate for global and regional productivity losses from unaddressed vision impairment (appendix 1 pp 51–53). We systematically searched for employment gap data for people with vision impairment, identifying 11 reports, with limited geographical distribution (appendix 1 p 52). Productivity loss calculations included the number of people with blindness or MSVI of working-age (15–64 years) in 2020, national employment rates for 2018, per-capita gross domestic product for 2018, and employment gap data published between 2004 and 2018. Values are presented for 2018 in US$, adjusted for purchasing power parity.\nIn 2020, it was estimated that globally, 18·1 million (95% UI 14·4–22·6) people are blind and 142·6 million (112·5–179·6) are living with MSVI in the working-age group. The overall relative reduction in employment of people with blindness or MSVI was estimated to be 30·2%. We estimated that the global annual productivity loss was $410·7 billion (95% uncertainty interval $322·1–518·7 billion), which represents 0·3% of the gross domestic product of the 21 GBD regions in 2018. Potential productivity losses were estimated at $43·6 billion, ($34·4–54·5 billion) attributable to blindness, and $367·1 billion ($287·7–464·2 billion) attributable to MSVI. Figure 12 shows the productivity losses for each GBD region. Productivity losses were highest in east Asia ($90·4 billion, $70·5–115·3 billion). Productivity losses as a proportion of gross domestic product was highest in south Asia (0·6%).\nOur new analysis provides a robust estimate of the global annual productivity loss attributable to vision impairment. For the first time to our knowledge, regional VLEG–GBD estimates were used to estimate the number of people with vision impairment in the working-age group and regional employment reduction variables derived from a literature review. However, additional productivity loss components were not included in our analysis because reliable data at country and regional level remain scarce. The components that were not included are absenteeism and presenteeism (reduced productivity in the working place), premature mortality, people older than 64 years, productivity losses of caregivers, and value of time lost from unpaid or informal labour activities. Data do not sufficiently differentiate between reduction in employment for blindness and MSVI. Therefore, we only included components for which sufficient evidence was available, and consequently the magnitude of productivity loss could have been underestimated.\nOverall, this analysis indicates that blindness and MSVI have substantial economic impact worldwide and highlights the opportunity to unlock human potential by addressing avoidable vision impairment and providing rehabilitation services to enable people to work.\nAs an adjunct to the systematic review, we examined cost-effectiveness ratios of eye health services and interventions (appendix 1 pp 54–57). We identified 182 reports for 16 ophthalmic conditions. The most frequently studied interventions addressed age-related macular degeneration,53 glaucoma,32 cataract,29 and diabetic retinopathy.27 We focused on cataract and uncorrected refractive error interventions and only included studies reporting health benefits using DALYs or quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Costs were adjusted to 2018 values expressed in US$ purchasing power parity.\nFor cataract, we identified 11 publications providing 58 separate national or regional cost-effectiveness ratio estimates.37, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165 The average cost-effectiveness ratios are shown in figure 13. The studies are heterogeneous in perspective, costs included, surgical procedure, and assumed duration of the health benefit, which limited our comparison. The cost-effectiveness ratio ranged from $5 per QALY gained in India to $24 783 per QALY gained in the UK. However, most ratios were less than $1000 per DALY averted or QALY gained, and in 19 (33%) countries the cost-effectiveness ratio was less than $100 per DALY averted or QALY gained. In general, LMICs reported more favourable cost-effectiveness ratios for cataract surgery than did high-income countries. Two studies from India158 and Nepal160 showed that the cost-effectiveness ratio of a manual small-incision cataract surgery ranged from $5 to $95 per QALY gained and phacoemulsification surgery ranged from $47 to $142 per QALY gained. The highest estimate, from the UK, used a wider perspective, including personal social-care costs.163 The higher cost-effectiveness ratios in some studies, mostly from high-income countries, might be partly because of a higher proportion of mild vision impairment in those receiving surgery and possibly higher remuneration to eye care professionals in high-income countries than in LMICs.\nThere were two studies on screening and treatment of uncorrected refractive error in schoolchildren, providing 16 separate national or regional cost-effectiveness ratio estimates (WHO subregions), and an additional cost-effectiveness ratio analysis for a facility-based refractive error service in Zambia.165, 166, 167 The average cost-effectiveness ratios, shown in figure 14, ranged from $95–184 per DALY averted in southeast Asia D, to $987–2127 per DALY averted in Western Pacific A. The most cost-effective strategy ($95 per DALY averted) in all 14 regions involved screening children in the age group 11–15 years.166 The cost-effectiveness ratio exceeded $1000 in only three regions: Europe A, West Pacific A, and rural India. Reports in India showed that cost-effectiveness ratios for screening and treating schoolchildren were lower in urban areas ($264) than rural areas ($1448).167 Both studies concluded that screening and treating schoolchildren for uncorrected refractive error seems to be economically attractive in many settings and world regions.\nThe wide range of cost-effectiveness ratios suggest regional variations in resource use, costs, and patient characteristics, and heterogeneous study methods such as the cost component, measurement of health benefits, duration of health benefits, and use of different discount rates. This heterogeneity is common in health economics, but limits comparability. The low costs per QALY gained or DALY averted indicate that cataract surgery and refractive services are cost-effective in many settings, encouraging countries to prioritise eye care services. Cataract surgery seems favourable compared with other essential surgical procedures and non-surgical public health interventions in LMICs.168, 169 However, cost-effectiveness ratios are only one consideration when making resource allocation decisions; others include the locally relevant cost-effectiveness ratio threshold, budget, feasibility, and other specific context factors.170\nOur systematic review and analyses highlighted marked methodological heterogeneity, limitations, and data gaps in eye health economics literature. To address these several actions are needed.\nFirst, standardised methodological approaches and reporting need to be adopted, following international guidelines for health economic evaluations.171, 172, 173 This improvement would increase reliability and enable the comparison of findings between settings and over time. This Commission calls for an international consensus on the process to develop guidance for eye health economic studies and standardise approaches for core components and analyses, particularly for the cost of illness.\nSecond, more standardised data need to be collected from diverse settings and repeated over time. Our review revealed that data are particularly scarce from LMICs, a gap that needs to be urgently addressed to better inform policy and planning decisions. This step will require financial investment and development of capacity for local data collection and analysis. Opportunities to integrate data collection into routine health system data processes should be investigated. Few long-term studies have revisited estimates over time; these would be invaluable to monitor trends and the impact of interventions.\nThird, robust, comprehensive economic impact analyses should be developed to better understand the true impact of vision impairment. Our productivity loss analysis provides only a partial perspective and is limited by the availability of data. A systematic approach in a representative set of countries is needed to collect data to inform more comprehensive models. For example, to improve the estimation of productivity losses, more data are needed in relation to vision impairment and its impact on employment status, wages, absenteeism, and presenteeism.\nFourth, better analyses are needed on cost-effectiveness, budgetary impact, and feasibility in a broader range of settings to better inform national decision making. Cost and cost-effectiveness analyses evaluating alternative service delivery approaches should be done—eg, moving to greater primary-care-based and community-based delivery platforms, integration with other services, and task sharing. Extended cost-effectiveness analyses that would include health system objectives, such as improved financial protection and equity to inform policy and planning decisions, are needed.\nTo investigate how research relates to the distribution and causes of vision impairment, we examined all primary peer-reviewed research on eye health published between 2000 and 2019 using a systematic search of online databases and a semi-automated bibliometric analysis (appendix 1 p 58). After excluding editorials, comments, reviews, and case reports, 156 954 articles were analysed. There was a 50% increase in research output across two decades (62 868 publications for 2000–09 vs 94 086 for 2010–19). Only 4% of publications were trials. One notable finding was the three-times increase in the number of publications from China (3602 vs 10 594). Almost half (42%) of publications were on one of the five leading conditions, glaucoma being the most frequent (11·0%), followed by cataract (9·3%), and refractive error (8·8%; appendix 1 p 59). Overall, these findings appear in line with the need for research to focus on leading causes of vision impairment.\nHowever, there is substantial maldistribution in the geographic focus of eye health research (figure 15). Almost three-quarters of published reports are from high-income countries. Several regions such as southeast Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and sub-Saharan Africa, had particularly low research output per person. We anticipate high-income countries will continue to produce a large proportion of basic science, therapeutic, and translational research, although this distribution is changing with the emergence of India and China as major pharmaceutical centres. It is important that all regions have a solid local evidence base on the epidemiology of eye disease and an equally strong understanding of which treatments and service delivery approaches are most effective in their settings. A major gap is the lack of research that explores solutions to eye health problems, particularly in LMICs, where decision makers do not have sufficient and contextually relevant evidence. This gap was highlighted in two systematic reviews.174, 175 For the first review, of interventions that aimed to increase attendance at diabetic retinopathy screening, 66 randomised controlled trials were identified, none of which were done in LMICs.174 The second review of interventions to improve access to cataract services in LMICs identified only two studies.175\nGiven the magnitude of vision impairment in sub-Saharan Africa, we did an in-depth review of randomised controlled trials done in this region since 2000 (appendix 1 pp 60–61). There were four key findings. First, geographic spread of the 86 trials was limited; 16 countries had at least one trial and more than half were done in Nigeria, South Africa, Ghana, or Ethiopia (appendix 1 p 61). Second, trachoma (28 trials) and onchocerciasis (17 trials) were most the commonly assessed. High-quality trials have been crucial for shaping disease control and programme success. Third, trachoma and onchocerciasis research communities are well coordinated in identifying key questions and minimising unnecessary duplication; they engage in extensive collaboration with government-led programmes on neglected tropical disease and their funders recognise that research is needed to develop elimination strategies. Finally, 16 trials were about glaucoma. Given that glaucoma has a high prevalence in many African populations and the uncertainty around how to address this issue, we believe that concerted research action is urgently needed to develop contextually relevant management strategies for glaucoma.\nInequality is pervasive in medical science; eye health research is no exception.176 Equity and diversity in research teams produces higher quality science that better meets the needs of society. This Commission explored equity, diversity, and inclusion in eye health research in three ways.\nFirst, we assessed female authorship in eye health research since the beginning of 2000 to the end of 2019 (appendix 1 p 58). There were almost 880 000 authorships; gender could be assigned to 780 000. Around 33% were female across the whole timespan. Since 2000, female authorship increased from 28% to 37%. Women held 36% of first authorships and 24% of last authorships.\nSecond, we assessed diversity of 112 ophthalmology journal editorial boards listed in Scopus (appendix 1 p 62). Gender and country of affiliation were available for 5061 editorships. Women held 23% of editorships and 11% editor-in-chief positions. 72 countries had at least one editor; 1643 (32%) of 5061 editorships were held by researchers in the USA (25% women), compared with only 15 (0·2%) across all of sub-Saharan Africa (20% women). Among 47 countries with at least five editorships, the proportion of editorships held by women within each country ranged from 0% to 60% (median 22%).\nThird, we assessed authorship of 89 reports from 86 randomised controlled trials in sub-Saharan Africa to evaluate the extent to which researchers from the continent itself and female researchers were involved. All but one of the 89 reports included authors who originated from the country of the study. Researchers from the country of the study held 51% of all authorships, 74% of first authorships, and 43% of last authorships. However, female researchers from the country of the study held only 8% of all authorships, 12% of first authorships, and 8% of last authorships.\nChange is required to improve equity, diversity, and inclusion for women, and other under-represented groups. Strategies for organisational change have been outlined and the need for measurable targets has been reinforced.177\nThe Lancet has shown how editors and publishers can address gender gaps and set diversity targets, leading to increased inclusion of women and people from LMICs among its authors and reviewers.178 We commend this pledge, and in preparing this Commission we aimed for balance in gender and LMIC representation. Despite our efforts, the proportion of commissioners who are women (44%) or originate from LMIC (38%) falls short of parity. Among our subsidiary papers, more than 50% of authors were female (more than two-thirds held first authorship).\nDelivery of eye health within universal health coverage requires substantial expansion in capacity to deliver high-quality research in LMICs. We call for investment in institutions in LMICs so that eye health research is primarily executed by researchers living and working in the region. The analysis of randomised controlled trials in sub-Saharan Africa highlights that most research in this region appears to have substantial academic involvement from high-income countries. A structural shift is required so that LMIC institutions increasingly take the lead and are supported by equitable partnerships that address priorities identified within the region. Such partnerships need to maximise meaningful capacity building for local researchers. Previously, some externally driven research projects have failed to sufficiently consider this issue, with local eye health personnel limited to data collection roles as opposed to scientific design and leadership. Subsequently, personnel might be included as authors without being empowered to engage in a meaningful way that develops their research skills. Some lessons can be drawn from the Commonwealth Eye Health Consortium, which built eye health research capacity in LMICs (particularly in sub-Saharan Africa) by providing Masters degrees, doctoral scholarships, and postdoctoral fellowships, with a focus on mentoring and empowering independent researchers. More regionally focused peer-reviewed journals are needed. Some regions might need capacity development support for longer. Increasingly this involves South-South collaboration, with the development of research community networks. This improvement is important considering that there are few, widely dispersed eye health researchers. Funding arrangements are very important for equitable partnerships, with a need for LMIC institutions to take the lead role in obtaining and managing funding.\nGlobal eye health research needs to focus resources on key questions to maximise benefit. Previous research prioritisation processes were done in the UK, the USA, and for LMICs; these included expert panels with or without open calls for contributions from clinicians and the public, including people who live with vision loss.179, 180 To collectively identify and focus on key areas that need attention in the upcoming decade, this Commission did a global prioritisation exercise. We drew on the Grand Challenges method, which involves a three-round modified Delphi process (appendix 1 p 63).181 We recruited 336 people from 118 countries, working in clinical practice, eye health system management, research and policymaking, and people who live with vision and eye health problems. In round one, participants were asked the question “What are the grand challenges in global eye health?” and could nominate up to five challenges and five corresponding solutions. All 3400 responses were thematically analysed and consolidated into 85 unique challenges. Ranking was done across two rounds to arrive at 16 priority challenges (panel 4).Panel 4Prioritised Grand Challenges in global eye healthImprove treatment (condition-specific)•Develop models to encourage population demand and ensure access to accurate refraction and affordable, good quality spectacles.•Identify and implement strategies to improve the quality, productivity, equity, and access of cataract services.•Improve child eye health by integrating evidenced-based primary eye care services for children into general health services and ensure strong connections to secondary eye care services. Develop and implement sustainable school eye health programmes, including screening and management for refractive error or amblyopia, which are well integrated within education services.•Develop and implement effective, accessible, and inexpensive pathway approaches for screening, diagnosing, monitoring, and managing glaucoma.•Develop and implement one-stop services for people with diabetes by integrating diabetic retinopathy screening services with general diabetes care and develop robust systems to ensure ongoing follow-up and referral for assessment and treatment.•Develop and implement evidenced-based, effective, sustainable, and context-relevant screening and early detection strategies for eye conditions.Health system•Encourage governments to prioritise integrated people-centred eye care services for universal health coverage.•Develop and implement evidence-based strategies for the effective integration of eye health services between the primary, secondary, and tertiary level to improve referral pathways, ensuring recognition of those who need secondary care and a timely, reliable, accessible, and affordable care mechanism.•Develop and implement evidence-based strategies for the effective integration of eye care at the primary care level and with other medical services (eg, child health, diabetes or other NCD services), ensuring that services are widely accessible, affordable, of high quality, and meet the primary eye care needs of the population.•Strengthen the information system for eye health within health facilities, integrating them into national systems.•Ensure financing for eye health exists within national budgets and financing structures and increase the investment.Access and equity•Develop and implement services that prioritise, and by design, reach marginalised or vulnerable groups (women, poor communities, Indigenous people, ethnic minorities, people with disabilities, people in residential care, prisoners, and refugee camps) and people living in rural communities with quality affordable eye services.•Develop and implement strategies that reduce out-of-pocket costs for those requiring eye care who are unable to afford full-cost services—eg, subsidy, tiered pricing, or insurance.•Develop and implement responsive programmes to increase the access to and use of eye health services and treatment—eg, reduce barriers to accessing services and increase demand through greater awareness of need and confidence in health-care provision.Build resource capacity•Increase support from international bodies, professional bodies, colleges, and non-governmental organisations, for geographical regions with severe eye health resource shortages.•Strengthen leadership and public health expertise across all levels of eye care and ensure that national leadership can influence policy and resource allocation. Additionally, strengthen regional and national professional bodies for eye health practitioners.\nSix of the 16 challenges focused on improving specific services and treatment for cataract, refractive error, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and children's eye diseases. The available evidence for each condition warrant different research approaches. For example, cataract and refractive error can be treated by well-established and efficacious interventions, but these do not reach all who could benefit with sufficient quality to be effective. Implementation research is needed to fill this gap; there are few examples, perhaps the most well known is onchocerciasis, for which implementation research was done to determine the best way to distribute ivermectin. Optimal treatment and implementation approaches also need to be determined, in different populations, for glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy to improve acceptance and sustained uptake of lifelong care (panel 5).Panel 5The challenge of glaucomaGlaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness (age-standardised prevalence), which results in substantial disability before blindness, yet remains undertreated globally (Bourne et al, 2020). In most prevalence surveys from high-income countries, less than half of all detected glaucoma was previously diagnosed, and in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) over 90% of people with glaucoma are not in care (Tham et al, 2014; Vijaya et al, 2008; Kyari et al, 2015). This high percentage is because glaucoma is mostly asymptomatic until relatively late in the disease. As many as 35% of people are blind at diagnosis in LMICs, precluding effective interventions that would have prevented vision loss (Ramakrishnan et al, 2003; Buhrmann et al, 2000; Kyari et al, 2013; Abdull et al, 2015). Glaucoma lacks a one-stop solution such as cataract surgery, because of its chronic nature and complexity of management. In the absence of simple and affordable diagnostic and treatment solutions, the global eye health community has not prioritised glaucoma—eg, when VISION 2020 was being developed (WHO, 2000). There are several crucial issues.First, there is a need to provide effective treatments that prevent glaucoma progression, and maybe someday, restore function to those with glaucoma damage. Several high-quality clinical trials have shown that lowering intraocular pressure slows, and in some cases stops, glaucoma progression (Garway-Heath et al, 2015; Collaborative Normal-Tension Glaucoma Study Group, 1998; Heijl et al, 2002). To do this intervention safely and effectively remains a challenge in all resource settings. The current treatment is long-term topical ocular hypotensive drops, but poor compliance and ongoing costs are major challenges in LMICs (Newman-Casey et al, 2020). Laser trabeculoplasty, which can be administered in a single session, is one effective strategy that has shown effectiveness in locations with scarce resources (Gazzard et al, 2019). Unfortunately, trabeculoplasty rarely provides lifetime control of intraocular pressure. Future hope is that more effective surgical or laser approaches will provide safe and sustained pressure lowering. Many novel approaches have been developed in the past decade, but none are able to overcome these challenges (Poitras et al, 2019).Second, individuals need to be monitored to determine whether their glaucoma is progressing so that treatment can be changed or escalated when needed. Such monitoring presents challenges for more remote and resource-limited populations. However, glaucoma monitoring is undergoing a rapid evolution and home-based monitoring using off-the-shelf technology might become available in the near future (Che Hamzah et al, 2020). The growth of vision centres in India and elsewhere, staffed by mid-level ophthalmic personnel and supported remotely by ophthalmologists, is an example of how to provide ongoing monitoring and shared care for people living in remote settings.Third, affordable and effective screening approaches are needed to enable identification of individuals at risk of sight loss. Major advances in automated grading of optic disc photographs has led to highly accurate glaucoma diagnosis on the basis of a single photo (Li et al, 2018). Widespread use of screening using fundus imaging with artificial intelligence-assisted grading could allow glaucoma to be diagnosed alongside the other major causes of blindness at low cost. Implementation studies are needed to determine how and where to apply these new tools.Innovation in glaucoma detection and management, which will probably occur soon given the rapidly improving technology, could catalyse a new care model in which earlier detection and effective long-term intraocular pressure lowering combined with remote monitoring can prevent unnecessary blindness globally. To reach this goal, the global eye care community needs to include glaucoma in eye care planning, recognising the centrality of the patient as a partner in management. Many important research questions remain unresolved and require substantial investment and a concerted global effort to answer.References for this panel can be found in appendix 1 (p 109).\nFive of the 16 challenges related to health system factors including: advocating for and establishing the policy framework to implement people-centred eye care for universal health coverage; strengthening integration between primary and secondary levels of care, and between eye care and other health services; and strengthening the health information system and ensuring better budget allocation for eye care. Two challenges reflected the need to address shortages in human resources for eye health in parts of the world—eg, sub-Saharan Africa, and to increase capacity of eye health personnel in public health and leadership. These challenges could benefit from the application of health systems and policy research to answer questions such as to what extent improving integration between primary and secondary eye care services improve coverage, quality, and equity, and reduce out-of-pocket costs.\nEquity is a crucial issue for universal health coverage and is of relevance to any service delivery-related research. We identified three challenges concerned with improving access and promoting equity, reaching vulnerable and marginalised groups, and developing and testing strategies to reduce out-of-pocket costs. Disadvantaged groups might have worse outcomes that are obscured by aggregate data. A simple step is to disaggregate data by the minimum set of social variables that are relevant in each context. In addition, equity-relevant reporting guidelines and frameworks are available and can be used in eye health research to consider equity in the design, analysis, and reporting of research.182, 183 These challenges highlight the need for researchers to include people with vision impairment and communities that the research is targeting in all aspects of the process, from identifying the research question to co-designing and implementing the study, data collection, analysis, and dissemination.\nWe believe this list of challenges serves as a starting point for immediate action that needs to be taken by researchers and funders. We call for funders to use the grand challenges to guide their research investments. Further, the list provides an opportunity for consortia and networks, advocacy organisations, universities, and governments to organise their activities around these challenges. In 2021, the authors of this Commission will seek to cohost a workshop to generate a research agenda and establish collaboration opportunities. The outputs of this workshop will include a strategy for periodic monitoring of eye health progress.\nWe have identified six crucial actions to generate and use evidence to promote eye health within universal health coverage. First, to develop a research agenda based on the grand challenges. Second, to increase solution-focused research including more contextually relevant implementation and health systems research, in partnership with patients, communities, service implementers, and policy makers, with an emphasis on ensuring that services address the leading causes of vision impairment in terms of coverage, quality, equity, and financial protection. Third, to ensure more emphasis is put on translating research findings into policy and practice, including better partnership with policy makers and integrating eye health research into general research priorities. Fourth, to avoid research waste by ensuring relevant questions are answered by adequately powered, robustly designed studies that are informed by systematic reviews of all the available evidence. Fifth, to support capacity building through equitable North-South and South-South partnerships between researchers and research institutions. Sixth, to ensure inclusion by monitoring diversity of research teams with structural change toward better inclusion, and by including communities and patients throughout the research development process.\nThe UN has set ambitious SDG targets for 2030.28 This Commission argues that eye health is integral to advancing sustainable development. Extensive evidence shows that improving eye health contributes directly and indirectly to several SDGs. Vision impairment profoundly impacts education and work, with substantial implications for poverty and the economy. Improving eye health benefits quality of life, general health, and wellbeing.\nUniversal health coverage is central to delivering SDG3 (good health and wellbeing). We reason that universal health coverage is not universal without affordable, accessible, high quality comprehensive eye care. One of the leading recommendations in the WHO World report on vision2 is “making eye care an integral part of universal health coverage” through implementation of integrated people-centred eye care. However, this ambition is far from being realised. In many regions, the scale and approach of existing service delivery are insufficient to meet current population needs, let alone projected increases in the magnitude of chronic eye conditions and vision impairment by 2050. In view of likely benefits to sustainable development, increasing need, and availability of cost-effective scalable interventions for many common eye conditions, the case for urgent action on eye health is compelling. Global eye health needs to take its rightful place within global development and the health agenda.\nWHO defines universal health coverage as follows: “Universal health coverage means that all people and communities can use the promotive, preventive, curative, rehabilitative and palliative health services they need, of sufficient quality to be effective, while also ensuring that the use of these services does not expose the user to financial hardship”.184\nThe core components of universal health coverage are often illustrated using a cube (appendix 1 p 64) and are intrinsically linked to health financing; the inner cube reflects budget constraints.185 To conceptualise eye health within universal health coverage, we have adapted the cube (figure 16). Universal health coverage is not a fixed final goal; population health needs change constantly and new treatment options are regularly developed, which presents challenges for defining interventions and measuring impact.\nHere, we explore what the delivery of high-quality eye care involves within universal health coverage, and the actions needed to move towards this goal by 2030. We propose a framework for how eye health services could be integrated within the broader health system and in non-health sectors. We highlight promising integration strategies across levels of care and examine key enabling factors: workforce, financing, and technology. We illustrate important issues by focusing on cataract surgery and refractive error services, drawing together the available data to understand how these services are currently doing in relation to universal health coverage (coverage, quality, equity, and financial protection). Finally, we discuss cross-cutting issues integral to delivering eye care within universal health coverage (monitoring progress, quality, access, equity, and political prioritisation).\nNational policy makers face complex, context-specific decisions in prioritising services that maximise public health benefit with finite resources.186 Cost-effectiveness is often an influential consideration, alongside need, sustainability, affordability, and feasibility. Additionally, countries might also consider equity—giving higher priority to services that benefit the poorest communities or those offering greater protection from financial risk.186 Ideally, coverage of high-priority services is extended to all before adding medium-priority or low-priority services.\nOur eye health economic literature review (section 4) highlighted the scarcity of cost-effectiveness data, particularly for LMICs, covering few interventions. Substantially more economic data are needed to inform countries that are deciding which eye health services to offer within universal health coverage. Considering current data limitations, how should eye care prioritisation choices be made? The epidemiology of eye disease is key, with an emphasis on the leading causes of vision impairment. However, many people presenting for eye health services have non-vision-impairing conditions and an eye health need that requires these services.\nWHO is currently developing a package of eye care interventions for multiple eye conditions, informed by epidemiology and field experts.187 The inclusion of interventions is guided by high quality clinical practice guidelines and systematic reviews. Countries will be able to use these tools to inform service inclusion decisions, method of delivery, and resource implications. However, the need for more cost-effectiveness data to inform decisions relative to other health priorities remains.\nAlthough countries vary widely in terms of population needs and health system capacity, core components necessary to meet general population eye health needs are similar in different settings. Ideally, a minimum package of eye care within universal health coverage would include primary eye care (promotion, prevention, and refractive services), eye care integrated within other services (neonatal care, school eye health, non-communicable eye disease services, care of older people), specialist ophthalmic services (to restore—eg, cataract surgery and preserve vision—eg, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration management), and vision rehabilitation services.\nDelivering services within or close to where people live and work results in increased access and use.188, 189 There are many effective eye health interventions that can be delivered at community level.\nEye health education and promotion within communities can lead to improved knowledge and service uptake.190, 191, 192 Promoting community-based facial cleanliness is integral to trachoma elimination programmes.21 Health promotion messages about meticulous contact lens hygiene are important in reducing corneal infections.193 To deliver education and promotion within integrated eye care, providers need to use more people-centred or community-centred design approaches, recognising that people are co-producers of health, not just users, beneficiaries, or choosers.194 More behaviour change and co-design research is needed. Previously, many interventions intended to improve facial cleanliness for trachoma ignored accepted theories and findings about behaviour change.195 A co-design process is underway in Ethiopia that seeks an in-depth understanding of social and cultural determinants of behaviour, working with community groups to propose and test contextually relevant strategies to promote facial cleanliness.196 Digital communication offers new routes to share and amplify such messages.192\nSeveral community-level interventions have shown effectiveness. Vitamin A supplementation and measles vaccination markedly reduced childhood cornea scarring.197 Rubella vaccination has rendered ophthalmic complications of congenital rubella rare.198 Mass drug administration for trachoma and onchocerciasis are delivered in community settings and frequently involve community members in distribution (community-directed).21 Community volunteers distributing <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightorange; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">azithromycin<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">chemical</span>\n</mark> were integral to trachoma elimination in Ghana.199\nSome countries train community health workers in primary eye care, including health promotion, vision testing, and referrals. Clinical trials are few; however, they indicate promise in identification of people with eye health needs. In Nepal, community health workers were trained to recognise corneal abrasions and infections using a torch, and to provide early treatment and referral, which led to improved outcomes.200 In Kenya, community health workers have been trained to use a smartphone-guided vision test and algorithm to identify and refer people with vision impairment and other eye problems.201 This approach has been tested in a cluster randomised controlled trial in Kenya,202 and preliminary findings (unpublished) have shown that an increased number of people with vision impairment and eye problems are attending eye clinics.\nHowever, sustaining programmes that engage general community health workers is hard.203 Although studies show efficacy of community health worker programmes under controlled research conditions, long term programmatic implementation is less certain.204 Implementation research is needed to establish approaches to sustainably embed basic eye health in training and activities of community health workers.\nTraditional eye remedies are widely used in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa to treat many eye conditions.205, 206, 207, 208 These remedies, frequently plant-based, are either home-made or sourced from traditional healers.205 They can worsen clinical outcomes through direct toxic effects, secondary infection, or delay in seeking appropriate treatment.206 Several studies have found that careful engagement and training programmes for traditional healers can improve practice, reduce the use of traditional eye remedies, and promote more rapid referral.208, 209 Such programmes are not widespread, but have potential for impact.\nPharmacies and informal drug sellers (eg, patent medicine vendors in Nigeria), can be the first source of health care accessed by people with eye conditions.207 They can be an important source of health advice and simple treatments. However, in some countries drug stores are poorly regulated, which leads to inappropriate advice or treatments such as sale of steroid eye drops to people with corneal infections.210 There is an opportunity in many settings to engage with pharmacists and drug stores to promote eye health messages, safe prescribing, and appropriate referral.\nMany countries have developed school eye health programmes (appendix 2 p 5).44, 45, 211 Screening approaches to identify children with vision impairment—eg, training teachers to test vision, appear effective.78, 212, 213 Most vision impairment in school-aged children is due to uncorrected refractive error.214 Providing services in schools (refraction and dispensing spectacles) increases access and uptake; low cost, high quality, ready-made spectacles can meet the needs of more than 80% of children with uncorrected refractive error.215 However, subsequent spectacle wear can be low; contextual interventions are required to increase spectacle use.216 An important consideration is how to reach children who are not in school.217 Comprehensive school eye health programmes also include health education and promotion, and support inclusive education for children with irreversible vision impairment.\nWell-coordinated action is crucial in Asia to address myopia, with strong collaboration between departments of health and education. This issue requires major changes in education delivery and preventive approaches to slow down the onset of myopia.218 For example, China is currently developing a national myopia strategy, with strong links between health and education (appendix 2 p 6).\nWorkplace injuries are an important cause of serious ocular morbidity.219 Minor abrasive corneal trauma during agricultural work is a frequent risk factor for corneal infection in south Asia.200 Using safety goggles while performing some tasks can prevent such injuries.220 The introduction of seat belts and firework regulations reduced ocular trauma; these should be promoted in areas where eye-related injuries remain common.221, 222\nWHO calls for strengthening eye care delivery within primary health care to complement work in secondary and tertiary eye care.2 In many countries, general primary health-care workers assess, treat, and refer people with eye problems. Primary health-care staff might also support community-based activities. Services vary substantially between contexts; here we outline some similarities and integration opportunities.\nLongstanding work has enabled primary health-care workers to deliver primary eye care and several training manuals have been developed.223 However, experience is mixed; establishing primary eye care within primary health care is not simple and requires substantial training investment and enabling environments. General health-care workers usually receive little primary eye care training, leading to important knowledge and skill gaps.210, 224, 225, 226, 227, 228 For example, training primary health-care nurses to test visual acuity did not increase referral rates in Malawi.229 Short supply of basic equipment and insufficient ongoing support to deliver primary eye care are frequent issues.203, 210, 224, 230, 231 Programme sustainability is challenging in areas that depend on external non-governmental funding.232\nThere are some promising strategies such as the Lady Health Worker programme233 in Pakistan, which includes primary eye care, increasing detection, and referral from the community; however, connecting to secondary care still remains challenging (appendix 2 p 7). In China, village doctors are trained by secondary eye care teams to identify and refer people with vision impairment.234 There is strong policy backing, whereby all people younger than 6 years and older than 65 years are offered a vision check in primary health-care facilities. This policy increases the number of people attending secondary units, which are more invested in supporting primary eye care services. An intensive programme in Rwanda, training health-care nurses in primary eye care, is now embedded in the general nursing curriculum which substantially improves access to eye care services throughout the country.235\nIntegration of primary eye care into primary health care services for younger children is a major opportunity. WHO identified ten key activities to promote healthy eyes in children.236 These activities were tested in Africa.237 A modification was included in the curriculum of WHO's Integrated Management of Newborn and Childhood Illness (IMNCI)238 in Tanzania (appendix 2 p 8). IMNCI is used in more than 100 countries to guide facility-based management of illnesses in children younger than 5 years, in the primary care setting, and is possibly a scalable and sustainable way to deliver interventions that address primary eye care needs of young children.\nScreening for diabetic retinopathy depends on close partnerships with general medical services. The delivery of screening is being transformed by the increasing availability of low cost retinal cameras operated by non-specialists, acquiring images for remote grading. In high-income countries, established diabetic retinopathy screening and treatment programmes deploy technicians to community settings to collect images for remote grading and decide on the referral. In the UK, the proportion of blindness in the working-age population, caused by diabetic retinopathy, has declined because of improved diabetes control and the national screening programme (appendix 2 p 9).239 Programmes are also being developed in LMIC settings. For example, in India, multiple public pilot programmes have been developed by the Ministry of Health, showing a substantial increase in the number of people screened at clinics for non-communicable diseases and community health centres.240 In sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean, multiple countries have developed regional or national diabetic retinopathy screening programmes that also embed diabetic retinopathy services within general non-communicable disease services.241\nThe delivery of primary eye care by general health workers is an area that requires systematic high-quality implementation research that analyses policies and systems to assess strategies, which would fully embed primary eye care within primary health care. Realistic expectations are needed in terms of the tasks that general primary health-care workers can do alongside other duties. In this context, technological developments hold promise in enabling task sharing.\nSome LMICs have permanently based mid-level ophthalmic personnel (non-physician specialised practitioners) in larger primary health-care facilities such as community ophthalmic nurses stationed in large district health centres in The Gambia.242 These nurses serve approximately 30 000 people and provide a bridge between primary health care and secondary services, supervising community-based primary eye care activities. Similar examples are seen in Ethiopia (integrated eye care workers) or in Tanzania (assistant medical officers in ophthalmology).\nOutreach services are delivered in more remote regions by eye care teams visiting periodically, and providing outpatient clinics and surgery.204 In some countries these services are widely used to increase access to surgery (eg, cataract).243, 244 Outreach services provide an opportunity for refresher training and supervision of primary health-care staff involved in primary eye care. However, communities can be left without access to services for extended periods, and this method might discourage the development of local eye care services.\nPrimary eye care facilities or vision centres, pioneered by several large non-governmental eye health organisations in south Asia, are satellite units operated by mid-level ophthalmic technicians (appendix 2 p 10).245 These units are separate from the public health system and are well integrated into the networks of secondary and tertiary hospitals, with teleophthalmology support and integrated electronic record systems.246 Approximately 80–90% of people presenting to vision centres can be managed at that level, and the remainder are referred on. However, the degree of integration with general public health structures is suboptimal.\nIn high-resource and middle-resource settings, primary eye care is mainly delivered by specialised personnel. In many high-income countries within community settings, primary eye care and refraction services are usually provided by eye health specialists, optometrists, or ophthalmologists in the private sector, with access to sophisticated diagnostic equipment, particularly in urban areas.\nOverall, populations are well served by easy access to a dedicated eye health workforce, closely connected to the general primary health-care system. This Commission recommends that, where possible, countries should move towards developing a dedicated eye health workforce to strengthen primary eye care in the public and private sectors. Cadres vary between countries. How these personnel are managed and integrated is an important area for implementation research.\nThere is an increasing need for refractive error services for adults and children worldwide. Access to refractive error and optical services in primary care settings is crucial. Services vary between countries and include optometrists, refraction technicians, and ophthalmologists. A competent workforce is important, in addition to good governance and equitable delivery, to ensure appropriate and quality spectacles for all.\nIn many regions, refractive error and optical services are provided by the private sector and therefore, are largely market-driven to an extent that other eye care services might not be. Market forces have been a major incentive for service development at scale in some settings, providing well for population needs. However, if the distribution of refractive error services is influenced by what providers consider a viable return on investment, populations in areas of high deprivation could remain without access to services.247 The cost of spectacles can vary greatly between settings, and can involve large out-of-pocket expenditure and be unaffordable to many people. In some countries there is a large unregulated market of optical shops that might provide poor quality services.248 The private sector usually does not share data on the number of refractions done and spectacles dispensed—an information gap that needs to be addressed for countries to be able to monitor refractive error services.\nHowever, the private sector represents a huge opportunity to bring refractive error services (and primary eye care more broadly) closer to communities. Indeed, given the magnitude of uncorrected refractive error globally, eye health cannot be addressed as part of universal health coverage without a major contribution from the private sector. To contribute to delivering eye health within universal health coverage, more consideration needs to be given to developing the right regulatory and market conditions to promote high quality, affordable, and equitable services.\nA strong regulatory framework for prescribing and dispensing refractive error corrections allows for coherent health promotion messages. Users' trust in the clinical competency and decision making of eye health workers is important for generating and sustaining service demand. By contrast, the sale of unregulated, variable quality optical devices (including via the expanding online market) might increase access, but at the possible expense of quality and sustainability.\nPublic–private partnerships are promising ways of increasing spectacle coverage while ensuring a safety net for those who are unable to afford private sector services. Examples include the national Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional (JKN) scheme in Indonesia, in which the vision test is provided by the public sector and a voucher is given to obtain spectacles from accredited private entities. The national school eye health programme in Trinidad and Tobago provides a government voucher for spectacles to reimburse the private sector provider. In Rwanda, the national insurance programme includes a sight test and a standard pair of spectacles, and more expensive spectacles will also be subsidised. In the UK, the Scottish Government made primary eye care free for all, at the point of use, and increased the fees paid to providers for their services. This change increased the viability of service providers in deprived areas, despite a lower demand for spectacles that generate more profit. Given the large and growing problem of uncorrected refractive error, other strategies and better evidence, with a focus on equity, are needed to improve effective coverage.\nA study249 from Uganda illustrates several challenges in integrating eye health services into primary health care and connecting people to secondary services (appendix 2 p 11). This study documented the journey of people with severe corneal infections seeking health care. Severe corneal infection is an acute painful condition requiring urgent specialist treatment within a few days of onset to prevent permanent sight loss. Although many people presented to a primary health-care facility within 2 days of symptom onset, the seriousness of their condition was frequently not recognised, appropriate treatment was not initiated, urgent referral to the hospital eye clinic was not given or followed, and the opportunity to prevent irreversible vision loss was missed. Many people visited multiple health facilities before reaching the eye unit for assessment and definitive management. Other studies250, 251 have also reported that attending additional intermediate health facilities for emergency and non-emergency conditions increases delays in accessing treatment and the direct and indirect costs for patients. Effective referral decisions and clearly defined pathways, ongoing supervision, and refresher training, would strengthen primary eye care. Referrals made using an electronic system have shown notable success in increasing the reliability and timeliness of attendance at secondary care facilities.212\nSecondary eye health services are important for diagnosing and managing the leading causes of vision impairment, beyond uncorrected refractive error. These services include surgery (for cataract and glaucoma), and laser and injection therapies (for diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration). Access to rehabilitation services remains inadequate in many regions and requires concerted action. In many countries, secondary units support the development and supervision of primary eye care. Tertiary facilities usually have a larger number of specialists, offering a range of subspecialty services with more sophisticated equipment than in secondary units to manage complex problems. Typically, ophthalmology and ophthalmic nurse training programmes are based in tertiary facilities. In many LMICs, secondary and tertiary eye health services have had long-term underinvestment in eye health staff, equipment, and infrastructure. These issues are high priority and need to be addressed to deliver efficient and effective services.\nAt secondary and tertiary levels, good communication and integration within the health service is needed—eg, prevention, screening, and treatment of retinopathy of prematurity requires close collaboration with neonatal unit teams. With the increasing availability of low cost retinal cameras, task sharing is becoming a reality in some locations, including a remote assessment by an ophthalmologist (appendix 2 p 12).252 Similarly, diabetic retinopathy needs to be well integrated into primary health care, from screening to clinical assessment, and treatment in secondary and tertiary units.\nVision rehabilitation is a set of services that assists individuals who experience disability to achieve and maintain optimal functioning. Services assist people with activities of daily living, accident prevention, and general physical and psychological wellbeing. People seeking vision rehabilitation face a range of challenges including, but not limited to, scarce services, physical barriers, inadequate skills and knowledge of the health workforce, and prohibitive costs. These barriers contribute to the global estimate of only 15% of people who could likely benefit from these services currently accessing them.253 Insufficient systematic data remains a persistent issue in raising the profile of vision rehabilitation and understanding the extent of the problem.\nA nuanced tension exists between identity and recognising disability being part of natural human diversity, the interaction of impairment with the physical and social environment causing disability and a perception of medical care narrowly construed as being to treat and cure disease. This tension becomes acute in determining who ought to have responsibility for driving progress in vision related rehabilitative services.\nConcerned by the general challenges in rehabilitation, WHO convened a meeting in 2017, Rehabilitation 2030: A call for action.254 Participants agreed to improve the integration of rehabilitation within health systems and strengthen intersectoral links. This shift recognised the gap produced by different government departments who have responsibility for rehabilitation and placed an emphasis on health to drive change as part of a continuum of care. The WHO World report on vision calls for vision rehabilitation services to be included within eye care interventions. Intersectoral partnerships with education, social services, and labour, are essential to provide person-centred support with complimentary and additional support for social, economic, and cultural participation.\nAlthough improvements in the external environment are important for inclusion and development, vision-related rehabilitative services are intrinsic to person-centred health care for people living with blindness or vision impairment. Because the availability and access to services is poor, this Commission urges a greater endeavour on the part of eye health policy makers, practitioners, administrators, providers, and donors to advance vision rehabilitation as an essential part of integrated people-centred eye care. This shift will require action by WHO, governments, and eye health leadership bodies such as the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness to raise awareness and build policies in collaboration with organisations for people with disabilities, rehabilitation professionals, and other sectors.\nDelivering eye care within universal health coverage relies on an appropriately trained, connected, and enabled workforce who are available, acceptable, and accessible.2 Workforce competencies and configuration need to be matched to population eye health needs. Services vary substantially in the complexity, type of equipment, facilities, and competencies required. Workforce plans for eye health need to be included in the overall national health workforce planning. Tools, such as the WHO Workload Indicators of Staffing Need, can be used to systematically analyse workforce requirements and personnel deployment to meet population needs.\nAn integrated eye care team within the public and private sector is needed and would encompass community-based volunteers, delivering health messages and preventive interventions, through to subspecialists in secondary and tertiary ophthalmology centres, providing complex medical and surgical treatment. Workforce structures and responsibilities differ between health systems; contributory roles include ophthalmologists, optometrists, allied ophthalmic personnel, general health workers, counsellors, equipment technicians, vision rehabilitation workers, managers, administrators (IT, finance, procurement, maintenance), and community volunteers (appendix 1 p 68). Team composition varies with population characteristics, disease patterns, and health system maturity. The workforce needs to be well connected horizontally, within the local health system, ensuring appropriate access points and localised care and vertically for effective referral of more complex problems (figure 17).\nWHO is calling for a change in eye health care delivery towards a more person-centred approach, with increased emphasis on service delivery initiated in primary care.2 This WHO vision needs a broader workforce view, involving populations and civil society alongside the formal health sector, in contextually specific community-based activities. To expand access to primary eye care in areas with few community-based allied ophthalmic personnel, sharing tasks with non-eye-care health workers is necessary. This expansion requires rigorous, competency-based training, reliable provision of essential equipment and consumables, supportive supervision from specialist services, quality assurance, and ongoing learning opportunities. The widespread introduction of core competency-based skills training for eye health into general medical and nursing training is a good starting point.\nPrimary eye care is preferably delivered by appropriately trained allied ophthalmic personnel, working closely with primary health care teams, located in easily accessible settings. Populations benefit from their expanded competencies and focus on eye health activities. For example, community-based vision centres in India. In high-resource and middle-resource settings, optometrists and ophthalmologists frequently provide the first point of contact for those with symptomatic eye conditions and can potentially provide opportunistic screening to detect asymptomatic conditions. Many LMICs need to develop training capacity for allied ophthalmic personnel and optometrists, and strengthen regulatory frameworks and ensure good governance.\nFor strong secondary and tertiary eye care services, planned investment in training and providing equipment for ophthalmologists and the associated team, is needed. The secondary and tertiary teams also support primary eye care, providing training and supportive supervision. Shaping the eye health workforce requires responsive planning and training for context specific needs.\nOptimising productivity or efficiency of services requires personnel with the relevant competencies and resources to be present at each level. Workforce productivity can be a major challenge, with underuse of specialist eye health capacity, evidenced by wide variation in the number of cataract operations done each year by ophthalmologists.255, 256 Simply increasing the workforce size is insufficient. An enabling environment is crucial for workforce productivity, as the shortage of eye health workers is compounded by limited access to equipment and consumables.230, 257 Maximising the effectiveness of each team member is key to increasing overall productivity, and needs to be addressed within a local and health system context.\nThere are good examples from different resource settings showing that service efficiency can be increased using careful process analysis and well-coordinated teamwork. With outreach teams supporting primary eye care and ensuring a steady flow of patients for cataract surgery and hospital support teams ensuring sufficient surgical supplies, sterile instruments, and regular equipment maintenance, the surgeon can be more productive and average around 1500 cataract surgeries a year, which is routinely achieved in settings such as Nepal and India.258 These principles can be applied in other LMICs.259\nEfficiency also varies considerably between the public and private settings, with variation in output attributed to training, personnel oversight, enabling workplace, incentives, and good management.230, 260 More research is needed on enabling and motivation factors that influence service volume and quality.261 Motivation and retention are driven by many factors such as the work, responsibility, achievement, organisational purpose, recognition and growth, compensation, security, status, work conditions, and the relationship with the supervisor. Understanding these factors in local contexts will help in building empowered, self-led teams. Retention, motivation, and performance depend to a large extent on how well this improvement is done.\nIn many regions, education is based on outdated curricula taught in a traditional, professional, siloed approach focused on knowledge of diseases rather than competencies. The patient-centred approach outlined in the WHO World report on vision2 has not always been adopted by the health education system.124 There has been considerable development; updated and educationally sound competency-based training curricula for ophthalmology are now available, with several international collaborations leading to extensive exchange of knowledge.262 There needs to be a further shift, with increasing emphasis on competency focused learning tuned to meet population eye health needs.\nSurgical training of ophthalmologists is an area of focus worldwide, with concern about insufficient training opportunities.263 To address these shortcomings, several initiatives are ongoing to strengthen surgical competency training programmes. The quality of these programmes and subsequent service provision depend on the training faculty, equipment, and opportunities to practise under supervision. There is increased emphasis on training the trainers to empower their approach. Programmes that are being cascaded in east Africa have transformed training practices.264 To improve the safety and efficiency of surgical skill acquisition, training has moved away from the apprentice model towards the use of simulation surgery. Simulation-based surgical education uses eye models and has been shown to rapidly and effectively increase surgical competence.265 This method increases confidence of the trainee surgeon and improves patient safety by reducing complications and surgical errors. Relying on the outdated apprentice model of surgical training is no longer appropriate. When underpinned by the principles of adult learning and encompassing key facets of educational theory, surgical simulation training is an important approach to bring novice eye surgeons to a competent level before operating on patients under supervision.\nLifelong learning is essential for the workforce to maintain skills in the context of rapid growth in medical knowledge and ever-changing health systems. In high-resource settings, formal and informal opportunities build professionalism and competencies in areas such as research skills, leadership, policy, and management. Equitable transferability of these learning opportunities to a global scale is becoming increasingly recognised through platforms such as the Orbis Cybersight programme and the International Centre for Eye Health open education courses. Shared learning has grown with the increase of a global online audience, particularly during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic. These resources enable self-directed learning and lifelong educational opportunities for eye health professionals, particularly beyond ophthalmologists.\nUniversal access to eye health can only be achieved if an appropriately skilled and equipped eye health workforce is available and accessible to all those in need. National and subnational analyses of workforce needs in relation to population eye health are crucial, but currently not readily available. The International Council of Ophthalmology (ICO) periodically assesses the global ophthalmology workforce. For 2015, they estimated 233 000 ophthalmologists in 194 countries (appendix 1 p 69).266 Similarly, the World Council of Optometry assessed the number and distribution of human resources for refractive services (2017–20), and reported 478 000 personnel in 126 countries. Recognition of optometry has developed in many countries and is either fully regulated, partly regulated, or legal recognition is underway. In some countries, the scope of optometry has expanded from primarily refractive services to some diagnostic and treatment services.267 These data are challenging to collect, but data on allied ophthalmic personnel have proven particularly difficult to collect because of the wide variability in nomenclature.268\nThe overall regional prevalence of blindness appears inversely correlated with the density of ophthalmologists per million population (figure 18). We recognise that these data are confounded by socioeconomic factors and not all causes of blindness are amenable to interventions by ophthalmologists. Several regions have clear shortages of ophthalmologists who are able to do surgery for cataract and other conditions, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, which ranges between 1·1 and 4·4 ophthalmologists per million population compared with a mean of 76·2 ophthalmologists per million in high-income countries (appendix 1 p 70). Similarly, the overall prevalence of all vision impairment appears inversely correlated to the combined density of ophthalmologists and optometrists (figure 18). Several regions have shortages of optometrists; interregional variation is stark, with a median of 1 per million population in low-income countries compared with 221 per million population in high-income countries.\nNational data on human resource density alone do not indicate access to eye care. There are several challenges that need to be addressed to reach universal access to eye health. First is the maldistribution of the workforce within countries. A study268 mapping eye health workforce, in 21 sub-Saharan African countries, reported the mean density of practitioners inside versus outside capital cities (ophthalmic surgeons 12·9 per million vs 1·7 per million, ophthalmic nurses 20·5 per million vs 7·7 per million, refractionists [including optometrists] 16·7 per million vs 2·5 per million, respectively). Similarly, in Latin America there is strong evidence of inequality in the distribution of ophthalmologists, with higher density in more socially advantaged urban geographic areas.261 Small island states, such as those in Oceania and the Caribbean, face extreme challenges in developing and retaining an eye health workforce (appendix 2 p 13). Second, by only monitoring numbers, we have no information on workforce competency or scope of service. The ICO survey266 explored whether ophthalmologists were surgically active, finding 0·9 surgically active ophthalmologists per million in low-income countries and 32 per million in high-income countries.\nUnmet needs, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia, and future projections indicate that the eye care workforce needs to be urgently expanded, especially because training an ophthalmologist can take more than a decade. In the ICO survey, most countries (60·3%) reported growing workforces; however, the annual global growth rate (2·6%) lags behind the annual growth in the global population aged 65 years and older (2·9%), which is set to double by 2050. How the workforce is trained, deployed, and empowered to deliver services is equally as important as the numbers. Maximising health workforce capacity by developing enabling environments, practices, and increasing motivation is crucial for ophthalmic public health.\nTeleophthalmology has been used for more than 20 years—eg, to enable consultations for remote communities in Australia.269 Eye health technicians in vision centres in India have been linked to ophthalmology hub hospitals.246 Teleophthalmology can be broadly classified as asynchronous—ie, when images are collected by technicians for later review—or synchronous in live consultations. Asynchronous teleophthalmology screening for retinopathy (diabetic and of prematurity) substantially increases service coverage in a population, and reduces travel and opportunity costs with a high degree of acceptance and satisfaction.270 Synchronous teleophthalmology aids highly trained personnel in diagnosis and decision making and immediate initiation of appropriate treatment, while reducing the burden of patients travelling.\nRapid evolution of mobile telecommunications is profoundly impacting life, even in remote locations. Many mobile health (mHealth) applications for eye care have been developed, although few have achieved widespread uptake.271 Further, insufficient regulation is a concern, with most publicly available eye care applications being untested or unvalidated.272, 273 Several visual function testing applications have been validated and show good performance compared with the conventional charts used in rural settings in Kenya and Ethiopia.274, 275\nBy linking smartphone applications to a wider system, the effectiveness, efficiency, and knowledge gains can be considerable. For example, a cluster randomised controlled trial of an mHealth system for school vision screening in Kenya found that teachers can reliably identify pupils with vision impairment using a smartphone-based visual acuity application, which then initiates an electronic referral for full assessment.212 This method more than doubled the uptake of secondary eye care services among those referred, with active tracing of referred individuals, and SMS messaging to nudge attendance. This system is being scaled up by the Kenyan Ministry of Health in several regions. An integrated mHealth system is also being scaled up in Pakistan, enabling community health workers to identify and refer people with eye health needs and increase vision testing and decision support in the community (appendix 2 p 14).\nThere is considerable interest in the potential of artificial intelligence and particularly deep learning in ophthalmology.276 This interest is driven in high-income countries by challenges in managing high volume chronic conditions (age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma). Deep learning is particularly suited to these conditions because their diagnosis and management is largely dependent on retinal photography (appendix 2 p 15) and optical coherence tomography (appendix 2 p 16). Artificial intelligence has many potential applications in eye health that could enhance delivery, optimise health system functioning, and lead to improved patient outcomes. Examples of potential uses that are in development include supporting point-of-care diagnostics,277, 278 surgical decision making (risk stratification),279 or patient management and treatment.278 The most likely early application in public health programmes will be in screening for diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity.280, 281 Artificial intelligence solutions can possibly be integrated with electronic medical records to support administrative tasks such as identifying patients with a specific eye condition or at-risk patients.282 Artificial intelligence can be used in clinical, epidemiological, and health system research to incorporate data on social determinants of health, identify at-risk patient populations, and help to prioritise scarce clinical resources.283 This area presents an opportunity to address the link between poverty and blindness, and the need to promote equity in eye health.10 Finally, artificial intelligence coupled with telemedicine and mHealth could help to reach populations with poor health system access, either because of geographical isolation or scarcity of human resources for eye health.280, 284\nThere is little information on implementing artificial intelligence in eye health delivery and even less on whether it could improve care or outcomes. Before deployment into routine clinical practice, artificial intelligence applications require external validation on data that were not previously used in algorithm development and should undergo rigorous safety and efficacy testing in prospective clinical studies. In 2018, IDx-DR was the first artificial intelligence screening product for diabetic retinopathy to obtain approval from the FDA, after demonstrating good diagnostic accuracy in a prospective trial281 done in a real-world setting.\nTo assess the extent of translation-ready artificial intelligence (in use or soon to be in use), this Commission did a scoping review for publications related to artificial intelligence in eye health since 2015 to 2020 (appendix 1 p 71). We identified 1256 primary data reports, most (60%) focused on retinal imaging (20% diabetic retinopathy, 16% glaucoma, and 6% age-related macular degeneration). Only 12% of reports addressed conditions that affect the anterior segment and 1·5% were on childhood eye conditions. Most (90%), reported on artificial intelligence model development and internal validation. Of 113 reports on external validation or successful deployment in clinical settings, most were for retinal conditions (58%), facilitated by greater availability of images. Arguably, the greatest potential for artificial intelligence to contribute to advancing eye health would be to assist in case identification and health system efficiency, helping people with uncorrected refractive error and cataract access services, neither of which are currently well represented in artificial intelligence development platforms.\nA substantial obstacle to artificial intelligence use in global eye health is the availability of large well curated datasets from multiple distinct populations for the development and validation of algorithms. Performance characteristics depend on the data on which algorithms are trained. This Commission did a global review to identify publicly available datasets of ophthalmic images.285 We identified 94 (including six with data from two world regions) open access datasets with more than 500 000 images from 23 countries; there were 13 datasets for which the country was not specified. 34 datasets originated from populations in Europe, 21 from southeast or east Asia, 16 from North America, nine from north Africa and the Middle East, four from south Asia, two from Latin America, and one from sub-Saharan Africa. The most common conditions were diabetic eye disease (35 datasets), glaucoma (19 datasets), and age-related macular degeneration (15 datasets). This under-representation of populations in LMICs is a new manifestation of the digital divide occurring in health, which we term health data poverty. The scarcity of representative datasets (public and other) limits the extent to which populations can benefit from digital health solutions and artificial intelligence systems. This limitation might lead to pronounced bias and failure of generalisability, with a risk of underperformance or even failure when transferred between settings and populations. We recommend that the visibility, accessibility, and use of existing public datasets is improved and that investment is made in developing new public datasets to support research, innovation, and validation in regions with insufficient health data.\nPublic spending to increase coverage and financial protection is an important source of eye health funding, particularly for the poorest people. However, analysis of government expenditure on eye health is difficult as only a few countries make the data publicly available (appendix 2 p 17), partly because national budgets and health accounts tend not to delineate eye health explicitly and rather spread it across several categories.288 Increased and better allocated public funding is central to making progress towards universal health coverage by promoting coverage, equity, financial protection, and sustainability.\nThe inclusion of eye health services in compulsory prepaid financing (such as social health insurance) could be an effective means to promote scale up and reach those most in need. In countries where eye care services are included in benefit packages under social health insurance, providers respond strongly to payment incentives, with positive and negative consequences. For example, in Thailand, higher payment for cataract surgery increased surgical rates.289 However, in other settings such as the Philippines and Indonesia, payment structures can contribute to cost escalation for schemes that have resulted in efforts to limit surgical volumes, sometimes with potential negative consequences for equity. When considering eye health services within social health insurance, who is covered and from where services can be purchased are crucial to access, efficiency, coverage, and financial protection. Specific measures might be required to ensure the most disadvantaged are reached, as illustrated in Rwanda (appendix 2 p 18).\nRegardless of the financing in place, out-of-pocket exemptions need to exist for the poorest and most vulnerable communities and health insurance schemes need to provide for poor individuals. In many LMICs, user fees are applied across the eye health sector by all health-care providers (public, private, faith-based, non-governmental organisations) to partly or fully cover the costs. Such out-of-pocket payments can be a barrier to health care use, often for those needing it the most, and can push people into poverty.290, 291 Studies in sub-Saharan Africa and east Asia have found that patient costs for cataract surgery can be as high as half of the average annual household income.292, 293, 294 Even when cataract services are included in insurance schemes, out-of-pocket costs can remain high because of complex and often opaque arrangements on whether or how particular items are covered.295, 296 Understanding how these costs reduce access and contribute to financial hardship is important for eye health in universal health coverage. Private financing (out-of-pocket, employer schemes, and private health insurance) will continue to be a substantial source of eye health funding in many contexts in the foreseeable future; therefore, more evidence is needed on financing arrangements and interventions that can make eye care affordable to all.\nEye health is an important component of universal health coverage, largely neglected by bilateral and multilateral donors. This Commission reviewed data on official development assistance from bilateral, multilateral, and private philanthropy organisations (appendix 1 p 72). Between 2014 and 2018, the annual average external assistance for all eye health was estimated to be approximately US$102 million, amounting to less than 0·06% of the total global official development assistance. Around 66% of the US$102 million was spent on supporting the elimination of neglected tropical diseases that cause blindness, which reflects the great commitment by the US Agency for International Development, UK Aid, and several philanthropic organisations to tackle neglected tropical diseases. In view of the benefits to sustainable development, health, and wellbeing, we believe that the case for increased investment in eye health is strong, taking into consideration the crucial issues highlighted in our Grand Challenges exercise.\nSeveral international non-governmental organisations provide substantial technical and financial support to LMICs. There is no comprehensive database that records all non-governmental organisation funding for eye health; therefore, estimating the total international funding is difficult. However, an analysis297 of annual reports suggested that 12 major non-governmental eye health organisations provided almost US$430 million in 2013, which included grants from bilateral and multilateral donors, and philanthropic organisations. Increased international support for eye health, in partnership with public and private actors, and vision-related international non-governmental organisations, would accelerate country-led efforts to move towards universal health coverage and fulfil the promise to leave no one behind. However, external funding needs to be considered as a supplement and not a replacement for government and other domestic expenditures on eye health.\nAlthough alternative financing mechanisms and private finance are unlikely to address all the unmet resource needs in eye health, they could provide substantial additional funding to progress eye health services rapidly within universal health coverage. The development of new alternative financing arrangements such as public–private partnerships (eg, Onesight), development impact bonds and loans, social enterprises, and results-based financing could help to fund the growing demand for eye care services (appendix 2 p 19). These initiatives will need to be evaluated on their ability to access new financial resources, their costs compared with other funding schemes, the predictability and sustainability of the financing, the effectiveness in delivering quality eye health outcomes, the financial protection they provide, and their ability to address inequities in access and use of eye health services.\nMore resources need to be raised to maximise impact, but optimising funding allocation on eye health services is also crucial. Evidence on how to allocate funding is scarce, so a data revolution is required to ensure “more eye health for the money”.298 This revolution would include more and better research and programme data to inform priority-setting and strategic purchasing. Topics for future research include costs and cost-effectiveness of interventions, relative efficiency of various delivery models, affordability (for governments and individuals), and financial barriers to accessing services (including direct and indirect costs). We also need to better understand how much funding is required and how much is being provided from different sources, which interventions are being supported, who is benefitting from them and who is being excluded.\nTo improve eye health: (1) more resources from all sources are urgently required, particularly in LMICs; (2) eye care needs to be integrated into general health financing for universal health coverage; (3) financial resources must be used wisely and a commitment is needed from all partners to ensure more eye health for the money; (4) countries need to improve social health insurance schemes as eye health needs change; (5) strategic purchasing arrangements need to be made to provide an incentive for efficiency, quality, equity, and financial protection; (6) step-change in data and evidence is needed on the financing of eye care, the value for money of interventions, and financial barriers to access and use of services; and (7) alternative financing arrangements need to be investigated.\nStrengthening eye health within universal health coverage requires clearly defined, scientifically robust indicators that capture key health system inputs, outputs, outcomes, and impacts. Indicators should provide insights to shape change and stimulate action. In this way, the indicator framework can be intrinsically linked to priorities, design, and continual improvement of services.\nThere are many potential indicators that could be used to monitor eye health services. For example, WHO has published several lists of eye health indicators in the past two decades: the 2002 framework for VISION 2020 included 35 indicators,299 the 2006–11 action plan had 29 core indicators and multiple additional indicators,300 the 2014–19 action plan included 19 indicators,124 and in 2017 WHO produced a list of 32 eye health indicators for the African region.301 The uptake and use of these indicators has been variable, probably because collecting such data is challenging and expensive.\nTo contribute to thinking on indicators, this Commission convened an international panel of 72 eye health system experts to participate in an indicator prioritisation exercise (appendix 1 p 73). We developed a menu of 22 indicators covering each stage of the results chain: inputs, outputs, outcomes, and impact (appendix 1 p 74–75). From these, seven core indicators were selected (table 4). These indicators were considered suitable to monitor universal access to quality affordable eye care services, including proxy measures for accessibility and affordability, and two effective service coverage indicators. We anticipate countries might wish to prioritise data collection for core indicators, facilitating regional and global comparisons of eye health progress within universal health coverage. Additional work is required to develop detailed indicator metadata, address gaps around specific conditions (eg, glaucoma), and consider how to measure the integration of eye health into the broader health system.\nIdeal indicators to track outcome progress within universal health coverage capture coverage and quality of an intervention, with disaggregation to assess equity. These are referred to as effective service coverage indicators. WHO and the World Bank have selected a panel of 16 tracer indicators to monitor progress towards universal health coverage, including several effective coverage indicators.302\nA useful framework for conceptualising effective coverage and indicators in general is the health-service coverage cascade model, first proposed by Tanahashi, and later revised by the Effective Coverage Think Tank Group and others.303, 304 This framework illustrates key dependencies and health system bottlenecks that prevent effective delivery of services (appendix 1 p 76). With each step down the cascade, additional members of the population in need do not progress towards the desired health outcome. Ideally, effective coverage measures are outcome-adjusted, reflecting the desired health impact. However, measuring the health outcome of interest is not always possible, particularly in chronic diseases, for logistical or cost reasons, or because of the delay between the intervention and realisation of the full health benefit. Therefore, earlier steps in the cascade are sometimes necessary to consider.\nIntervention or service coverage indicators measure the proportion of the population that needs a service and receives it. This measure depends on those in need attending a service provider that has all the necessary inputs available (staff, equipment, consumables) to deliver the service. Considering service quality, how closely the delivery follows guidelines indicates how likely the service is to result in the desired health outcome. These are quality-adjusted coverage indicators. For interventions that require ongoing acceptance and use, adherence-adjusted or acceptance-adjusted coverage indicators can be applied. Proxy indicators are sometimes used, if service coverage indicators are not available, and these provide a measure of health service provision.302, 305 Measuring equity in service provision by disaggregating data and comparing subpopulations—eg, by wealth quintiles, education, sex or gender, age, ethnicity, and geographical location—is very important.302\nEye health outcomes are currently not reflected by the 16 tracer indicators outlined by WHO.302 However, two indicators, effective cataract surgical coverage and effective refractive error coverage, have been proposed for inclusion in the Thirteenth General Programme Of Work 2019–23 framework306 by WHO and endorsed in the World report on vision.2 Both conditions are common and account for around 77% of vision impairment and these two indicators also have a broader relevance to the health system. Cataract surgery, one of the most frequent operations in many settings, is a marker for the provision of surgical services and spectacle correction by refractive error services is a marker for the provision of assistive devices.\nSeveral indicators have been developed for cataract surgical services, which are defined in appendix 1 (p 76).307 Cataract surgical rate (the number of cataract operations per million population per year) has been widely used for many years as a measure of service output. Cataract surgical rate is used to set and track a desirable target to address the backlog and ongoing incidence of cataract. Cataract surgical outcome is a measure of visual acuity outcome and reflects the quality of surgery. It can be reported by the individual surgeon, health facility, or by a programme. Cataract surgical coverage is measured in cross-sectional population-based surveys, such as the RAAB survey. Effective cataract surgical coverage combines the proportion of population covered and the visual acuity outcome (figure 19).308 The term operable cataract defines the threshold of vision impairment required for an individual to be included in the population denominator of people with cataract, which is used for estimating cataract surgical coverage or effective cataract surgical coverage. RAAB surveys estimate these coverages using an operable cataract threshold of worse than 3/60, 6/60, or 6/18. Each country determines which threshold is most relevant to their context.\nEffective refractive error coverage was proposed and described as a method in 2019.2, 309 Effective refractive error coverage assesses the proportion of people with refractive error who have received and use refractive error correction who achieve a specified visual acuity threshold (eg, 6/12); it takes into consideration the met, under-met, and unmet refractive error needs in a population (appendix 1 p 77). This method represents a major shift in the way refractive error is reported. Surveys previously focused only on counting unmet need (uncorrected refractive error) and excluded those who already had access to refractive error correction. An important consideration is whether spectacles are routinely used after being received, as reflected in the effective coverage cascade for refractive error services (appendix 1 p 77). This issue is particularly relevant for schoolchildren in many settings.216 When data for effective refractive error coverage are gathered using a population-based survey, the estimate considers people not adhering to spectacle use at that time as having an unmet need.\nUsing coverage cascade models provides helpful insights into appropriate coverage indicators and helps to identify key system blockages. Beyond effective cataract and refractive error coverage, examining service delivery effectiveness for other leading causes of vision impairment, such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration is possibly more complex. We have outlined potential approaches for these three conditions in appendix 1 (p 78–79). Identifying the population in need can be challenging because these conditions might be asymptomatic in the early stages. Also, a successful outcome for each condition is to stabilise vision and prevent further vision or functional loss, which can only be confirmed after long follow-up between starting the service delivery and future observations. Therefore, an effective coverage indicator might be unrealistic for these conditions, possibly necessitating quality-adjusted service coverage indicators, at least in the medium-term.\nDespite the reduction in age-standardised prevalence of vision impairment observed in the past 20 years, the estimated number of people with vision impairment has risen with the continuously expanding and ageing global population. To explore progress towards improved eye health within universal health coverage in more depth, we focused on cataract, a key tracer condition with more population-level data than refractive error or other conditions.\nWe looked at peer-reviewed and grey literature since 2000 to 2020 for evidence on the delivery of cataract surgery in relation to the dimensions of universal health coverage: access, quality, financial protection, and equity (appendix 1 p 80).310 We also analysed all available RAAB datasets from the past 20 years to calculate the effective cataract surgical coverage, disaggregated by gender. We summarise the scope of reported literature for key cataract markers in appendix 1 (p 81).\nCataract surgical rate was the most frequently reported indicator with data from the past 10 years available for numerous regions. Cataract surgical rate data were available for 175 countries since 2000. Over the same period, the median cataract surgical rate varied considerably by GBD super region, from 494 in sub-Saharan Africa to 10 136 in high-income countries (figure 20). The global median cataract surgical rate was 1700 per million population per year from reports during the last decade (total range 95–14 188, IQR 720–3906). A desirable cataract surgical rate is context specific and depends on the unmet need, quality of service, population structure, population cataract incidence, and other factors.\nThere were 203 national or subnational survey reports of cataract surgical coverage, including 104 in the past decade. However, around a third of RAAB surveys done between 2000 and 2018 were not reported in the public domain, raising concerns over the selective non-reporting of less favourable coverage. Analysis of these additional datasets would contribute to a more complete epidemiological picture.\nCataract surgical outcome—a clinical marker of quality—was reported for 197 studies, which were mostly cross-sectional population-based surveys with variable time intervals between surgery and observation. We only considered surveys that reported presenting visual acuity (vision tested using spectacles if available). During the past 10 years most regions had two or fewer reports on cataract surgical outcome (appendix 1 p 81). The longstanding WHO benchmark for a good outcome, following cataract surgery, is a presenting visual acuity of 6/18 or better. This threshold was set more than 20 years ago with the expectation that it can be achieved in 80% or more surgeries.311 Among 82 reports on presenting visual acuity since 2010, the median proportion of people achieving 6/18 or better in the operated eye after surgery was 60% (total range 28–82%; IQR 50–68%). The median proportion of people with vision of 6/60 or worse in the operated eye after surgery was 18% (total range 3–51%; IQR 13–25%). The distribution of outcomes by GBD super region is shown in appendix 1 (p 83). Data from high-income countries are reported in many ways, which prevents comparisons. However, population-based data from Australia indicate that presenting visual acuity of 6/12 or better was achieved in around 80% of people, and clinic-based data from the UK indicate this number is closer to 90%.312, 313\nMany surgeons audit their surgical outcomes. Collecting point-of-care outcome data is important to drive quality improvement. However, clinical outcome data collection is particularly challenging in LMICs, due to low postoperative follow-up rates. To investigate the validity of early postoperative data, which is more practical to collect, a large prospective study314 was done in 40 centres across ten countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. This study found that visual acuity measured during the first 3 days after cataract surgery was highly correlated with vision measured at 40 days or more after surgery. Consistent with previous findings, the final uncorrected visual acuity reached the WHO benchmark of 6/18 or better in only 64% of cases. Outcomes improved slightly with refraction, after which 85% had a best corrected visual acuity of 6/18 or better. Inadequate reporting of outcomes and frequency of poor results suggest that cataract surgical quality is not optimal and requires concerted action, with an emphasis on better integration with refraction services and strengthening of monitoring and reporting outcomes (appendix 1 p 84). Tools such as the Better Operative Outcomes Software Tool (BOOST), a mobile surgical outcome application, can facilitate the monitoring process.315\nThe use of effective cataract surgical coverage (proportion of people aged 50 years or older with operated cataract or operable cataract who have a good postoperative presenting visual acuity) has only begun since 2017, with a total of 28 available reports representing few global regions (appendix 1 p 81). To supplement these reports and assess progress in the past two decades, we have reanalysed the data from 149 RAAB surveys from 48 countries (appendix 1 pp 84–85). We then selected the most appropriate estimate available for each country. Some caution needs to be exercised in the interpretation of these data as many are subnational surveys and have been extrapolated to represent coverage in the whole country for the purposes of this analysis. Between 2000 and 2019, the median effective cataract surgical coverage for 48 countries was 43·4% (total range 6·5–85·7%; IQR 29·4–59·2%), for an outcome of 6/18 or better and an operable cataract threshold of worse than 6/60. Some inter-regional variation is present, although the data from some areas are scarce (figure 21).\nSystematic information on financial risk and protection in relation to eye health is rare, with only six reports worldwide from the past 20 years (appendix 1 p 81). For many people who are least able to pay, out-of-pocket payment for cataract surgery and presumably other procedures remains common.\nEquitable access to eye health services has been assessed by disaggregating data, most frequently by gender, followed by place of residence, and socioeconomic status (appendix 1 p 81). These variables need to be routinely included in population-based surveys and analysed, to identify and inform the design and delivery of services for marginalised groups. Disaggregation of larger datasets, particularly for cataract surgical coverage, has highlighted disparities between men and women.316, 317, 318 We have disaggregated the results by gender (figure 21), showing that women consistently have lower effective cataract surgical coverage rates. For example, data from the Nigerian and Sri Lankan National Blindness Surveys8 have been disaggregated by gender, marital status, and area of residence (urban or rural), for the prevalence of cataract blindness and effective cataract surgical coverage (appendix 1 p 85). In both countries, the effective cataract surgical coverage was particularly low for women who were widowed living in rural areas. Further work in the design and delivery of services is needed to ensure more equitable outcomes among women.\nThere are fewer population-based data on effective refractive error coverage, which have mostly been collected through national eye health surveys or subnational surveys using the Rapid Assessment of Refractive Error (RARE). Several of these studies are summarised in table 5. Only one study was from a high-income country (Australia). The median effective refractive error coverage was 22% and the range was wide at 0–94%. Despite few data, clearly, at least in LMICs, the effective refractive error coverage is often low and represents a substantial unmet need. Existing data gaps need to be urgently addressed to understand the scale of needs, to inform programme implementation, and track progress. An updated RAAB survey protocol will be released in 2021, which will support the collection of additional visual acuity data outlined in appendix 1 (p 77), to enable estimation of effective refractive error coverage.319\nClimate change is occurring, primarily mediated by greenhouse-gas emissions. Global health care is estimated to contribute to approximately 5% of all greenhouse-gas emissions.334 Eye care is a high volume service with a large number of consultations and procedures annually, and therefore, a substantial contributor to health-care emissions. With the ageing population increasingly requiring eye care interventions, we need to promote sustainable practices. We did a review to examine the extent and nature of the potential environmental impact of eye health services (appendix 1 pp 90–91). Evidence is scarce, with only eight reports meeting our criteria. A detailed carbon footprint of phacoemulsification cataract surgery has been estimated for individual centres in the UK and India.61, 335 For the same procedure, the UK centre produced 20-times more CO2 emissions than the Indian centre. To improve this field, tools are being developed to routinely measure environmental costs associated with cataract surgery as a mark of quality, alongside the other measures of high-quality services. Every aspect of practice can be examined and opportunities to reduce environmental impact can be identified.\nAccess to eye care is not equally distributed between and within countries, with marginalised and socially disadvantaged populations experiencing more difficulty in accessing the required care. This persistent inequity must be addressed for eye care to be realised within universal health coverage. Indeed, unless equity is prioritised, inequalities will probably increase in pursuit of universal health coverage, as the socially advantaged are more able to use new or improved services.336\nIn many high-income countries, people can access the eye care they need, although often the most marginalised groups such as Indigenous people or other minority ethnic groups are unable to access eye care, such as those in the USA (appendix 2 p 20). Another example is Australia, where most non-Indigenous Australians have access to good quality cataract surgery (effective cataract surgical coverage achieving 6/12 or better, 88·5%, 95% CI 85·2–91·2) compared with only half of Indigenous Australians (51·6%, 42·4–60·7).312 To explore how to improve access to eye care for these groups in high-income countries, we did two separate scoping reviews (appendix 1 p 92).337, 338 In addition, some of the key points for addressing eye health inequity for Indigenous Australians are described in appendix 2 (p 21).\nIn these reviews we identified 41 studies reporting strategies to improve access for Indigenous people, primarily in Australia (26 [63%]), and separately, we identified 67 studies reporting strategies for other minority ethnic groups, mainly in the USA (60 [90%]).337, 338 Strategies focused on diabetic retinopathy services were the most common (51% in the first review and 42% in the second). We mapped some of these strategies against a patient-centred health-care framework to show various ways in which access can be enabled through a pathway of having and perceiving a need for care; desiring, seeking, reaching, and using that care; and the subsequent health consequences (figure 23).339 The range of strategies outlined in figure 23 shows the complex nature of health-care access from the service and patient perspective, and the breadth of possible approaches to reduce inequity. Several of the most effective interventions addressed three or more access dimensions concurrently, often from the patient and service perspective. Despite the strong emphasis on reducing inequality in these approaches, only a third of studies in each review reported engaging the target communities during the design phase.\nA promising strategy in pursuit of universal health coverage for eye care is proportionate universalism, which aims to improve outcomes for all population groups and specifically targets disadvantaged groups to ensure that improvement is proportional to need at the outset, showing the greatest benefit in these groups.336 The benefit of this approach was shown in maternal and child health, with countries using proportionate universalism to reduce inequality between the poorest and richest quintiles and improving coverage at the aggregate level compared with countries using other approaches.340 There are examples of the need for proportionate universalism in eye health, such as in Nigeria and Sri Lanka, where national surveys revealed that unmarried rural women (mostly widows) had disproportionate cataract blindness.8 The social distribution of cataract blindness in these two countries (appendix 1 page 86) highlights the need to allocate resources and action proportionate to need, with a particular focus on identifying strategies to improve access to care for women in rural areas with low social support.\nUnfortunately, there are no published reports of proportionate universalism being applied in eye care. Indeed, there is little robust evidence on how to reduce inequity in eye health, including cataract services.341 We did an umbrella review of systematic reviews on gender and eye health. Only one of 58 included reviews described interventions to address gender inequality; the remaining reviews reported gender differences in the prevalence of eye conditions or access to cataract services (appendix 1 pp 93–94). To reduce this evidence gap, we did a modified Delphi process to identify priority groups and testable strategies to reduce inequity that can be assessed in future research (appendix 1 pp 95–96). Across two rounds we asked 183 participants worldwide to first nominate and then prioritise the groups which have the most difficulty and represent the largest number of people unable to access cataract services in their region, followed by the most promising strategies to improve access to screening and surgical services for cataract. Globally, three groups that need to be prioritised were identified as: people living in rural or remote areas, those with low socioeconomic status, and those with low social support. In most regions, data are not routinely collected on these characteristics in relation to vision loss from cataract and the access to services.\nSouth Asia was the only region in which women were among the top three prioritised groups, despite all regions having more women than men living with vision loss. One explanation for women not being prioritised might be because they are not universally disadvantaged, with some women able to access the required eye care. Married women in Nigeria and Sri Lanka were found to be the subgroup with the lowest prevalence of cataract blindness (appendix 1 p 86).8 This disparity between different subgroups of women highlights the need to disaggregate by more than one sociodemographic factor, which provides a more nuanced understanding of the need distribution and where to target additional resources. Equity-relevant targets are also needed. Services often aim to deliver 50% of services to women to be equitable. However, worldwide there are more women than men with vision loss and equity-relevant service targets would reflect the disproportionate number of women in need of care (figure 10).\nThe globally prioritised strategies to improve access to screening and surgery involved improving the availability of services, improving integration, and reducing out-of-pocket costs, whereas participants from high-income countries prioritised efficiency, targeting at risk groups and cultural safety (appendix 1 pp 95–97). Some of these strategies have previously been described and evaluated, primarily those targeted to rural dwellers, people of low socioeconomic status, or women.10, 49 A common reflection of this literature is that a multifaceted approach is needed to address the diverse nature of barriers faced by socially disadvantaged groups. For example, outreach screening combined with counselling, providing transport, and low out-of-pocket costs for surgery increased the uptake in rural Tanzania and Kenya, whereas cataract case finders in Madagascar were not successful as the people identified with operable cataract had no means to reach the hospital.243, 342 Access and equity are crucial areas in which to develop better evidence in the coming decade.\nUniversal health coverage will not be realised without a deliberate effort to build equity into design. This needs to be informed by a thorough understanding of the groups that are being left behind and meaningful engagement with communities to co-design approaches that meet needs equitably. More representative leadership in global eye health is also needed, which was highlighted in our analysis of organisations working in this field (appendix 1 p 98).343\nOver the past 30 years the eye health sector, including health ministry staff, civil society, eye health professionals, academics, and WHO, have worked hard to increase the global profile of eye health. Some good progress has been made—several World Health Assembly resolutions have been adopted,124, 344, 345, 346, 347 action plans implemented, and global coalitions formed.124, 300, 348 Despite these improvements, international and national political leaders have not sufficiently prioritised eye health, leaving it under-resourced and poorly integrated into national health systems.2\nTo analyse factors shaping global political prioritisation for eye health, we applied the framework developed by Shiffman and Smith (panel 6; appendix 1 p 99).349 This framework identifies four categories that shape political prioritisation in global health: power of the actors involved, ideas they use to portray the issue, the political context, and characteristics of the issue. The development of eye health services in China since 1949 provides an example of the impact that evolving political prioritisation can have on eye health service provision (appendix 2 p 22).Panel 6Determinants of political priority in global eye healthActor power: strength of individuals and organisations concerned with the issuePolicy community cohesionThere is a strong degree of coalescence among the eye health community on the issue. However, the sector needs to build partnerships outside the sector.LeadershipThe sector has produced excellent programmatic leaders but has few system leaders or external champions for the cause.Guiding institutionsWHO has provided some institutional leadership on vision as a health issue; however, such leadership has been largely absent within the broader UN system.Civil society mobilisationCivil society organisations have mobilised international and national political authorities to address the issue globally; however, eye health has been narrowly framed as a technical eye care issue and involved low public engagement.Ideas: the ways in which those involved understand and portray the issueInternal frameEye health actors generally agree on the definitions, causes, and solutions to blindness and vision impairment. However, they have not been sufficiently united in framing the issue.External frameEye health has not been portrayed in a way that resonates with external audiences, especially with political leaders.Political contexts: the environments in which actors operatePolicy windowsThe development of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) was a missed opportunity and eye health was not included. The UN Decade of Action on the SDGs and the WHO Thirteenth General Programme of Work with triple billion targets, including universal health coverage, provides new policy windows in which to integrate eye health.Global governance structuresSeveral World Health Assembly resolutions provide high aspirations for improving eye health. The International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness coordinates international efforts in blindness prevention, providing an effective platform for collective action with over 150 member organisations worldwide, including non-governmental organisations and civil societies, corporate organisations, professional bodies, and research and eye care institutions.Issue characteristics: features of the problemCredible indicators and targetsPrevious indicators and targets have been clear and ambitious but not realistic and not linked to a clear pathway for achievement, undermining their credibility. New indicators and targets linked to universal health coverage are under development.SeverityThe scale of the burden is substantial. But eye health, when compared with other health issues, is often regarded as a second-order issue by governments, because of the historic scarcity of evidence on measures of impact such as mortality. The sector has not yet managed to gain policy traction for the economic and development case.Effective interventionsEffective interventions are available and among some of the most feasible and cost-effective of all health-care interventions.\nMany aspects suggest that global eye health is well placed to attract political support. Vision impairment is associated with mortality (figure 6), and eye care interventions are among some of the most feasible and cost-effective in health care. The issue is also global; impaired eye health and the need for eye care affect large numbers of people across all socioeconomic groups and the life course. There is broad agreement within the global eye health community on the policy agenda; partnerships have enabled the development and delivery of highly successful eye health programmes, such as for trachoma control. In addition, the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness brings together a cohesive community of active organisations, giving the sector a platform and voice for collective action.\nHowever, even when global and national political commitments towards eye health have been made, resources have not been provided at the scale and breadth required to meet growing demand. Several factors could explain this shortcoming. The case for the importance, severity, and ubiquity of eye health has not been made with sufficient force. Key opportunities have been missed; one notable example is that eye health is not referred to in the SDGs.\nWHO has provided leadership, dedicated resources, and technical expertise to the great benefit of eye health, even though the institutional priorities set by WHO have fluctuated. Until the encouraging formation of the UN Friends of Vision group of Member States, such institutional leadership has been largely absent in the rest of the UN system. The missions of UNDP, UN Women, UNICEF, and the International Labour Organization all intersect and could be enhanced by better eye health, but generally vision-related activities have not been included in their work.\nInternal and external framing of eye health has been ambiguous. Although the sector has argued at times for integration of eye care as part of the mainstream health agenda, many high-profile successes are positioned outside public health systems and are viewed as vertical in approach. This ambiguity has reduced the need to compete against other health issues and eye health has often been omitted from health system strengthening and universal health coverage agendas.\nThe role of national and international non-governmental organisations and donors in financing and delivering eye health services has sometimes had the unintended effect of discouraging government ownership and resource allocation. In some countries, non-governmental organisations and donors are outside of government systems, limiting the responsibility and accountability of national actors. Some governments have come to wholly rely on the non-government sector for eye health service delivery and therefore have not engaged nor allocated their own resources to eye care within health system strengthening and universal health coverage.\nThis problem is changing. Increasingly the eye health sector has made a concerted effort to position vision within mainstream health policy, emphasising the need to embed eye care in national health systems and primary health care. Crucially, the WHO World report on vision2 recommends that eye health should be part of every country's journey towards universal health coverage.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic will probably transform the importance of health and health systems within government policy in general. Although long-term effects will take time to be understood, conceivably, there will be renewed emphasis on building resilient and responsive health systems. Following the pandemic, eye health needs to be considered as an essential part of health and associated health service packages. However, the pandemic will probably lead to deterioration in the social determinants of eye health for many, through increased poverty and reduced access to services in many countries.\nEye health cuts across multiple SDGs. The Decade of Action and delivery of SDGs, called for by the 2019 UN General Assembly, presents a new opportunity to position eye health equity as an integral part of the development agenda and to have it addressed by broader development institutions. This action would enable the case to be made at national level, to include eye care in economic and development plans, budgets and consolidate its place within health plans for universal health coverage. To integrate vision in the development agenda will require three major actions.\nFirst, eye health needs to be clearly framed as a development issue, which would have substantial and immediate benefits for prosperity and social progress. This Commission shows that addressing vision impairment is a realistic and highly cost-effective way of unlocking human potential, enabling children to gain an education and working-age adults to get and keep a job, and improving equality for women and girls who are more likely than men to have poor vision and less likely to receive treatment. These steps are more likely to resonate with political leaders, donors, and international institutions.\nSecond, cross-sectoral partnerships need to be built, including economic development, education, women's empowerment, business and transport, civil society, the technology, and private sectors. These partnerships are already taking place in some regions but will need to become much more widespread.\nThird, different kinds of leadership skills and capabilities need to be developed. The sector has produced many committed and effective leaders who excel at designing and managing eye health programmes. However, achieving progress across the development agenda will require leaving current approaches behind. A more innovative and adaptive approach that engages broad networks of diverse stakeholders is required. Leaders will need to be able to connect the whole system together.\nWe call on the global community to consider the recommendations outlined in the Key messages panel for urgent action. Vision is an enabling tool for sustainable development, accelerating delivery of the SDGs. We have presented the benefits of vision for everyone and supported these by evidence. Vision as an integral component of health has been insufficiently represented in the targets of the SDGs but the Decade of Action, called for by the 2019 UN General Assembly, presents an opportunity to reintegrate eye health into developmental and economic plans. To achieve this transition, the sector must build the right bridges, engage in new partnerships, and train new leaders skilled in systems change, which will be a global challenge for the next decade.\nInvesting in universal eye health is a realistic, cost-effective way of unlocking human potential by improving health and wellbeing, education, work, and the economy; it is essential to achieving the SDGs.</br></br>UNKNOWN URL AND TITLE</br></br>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the novel coronavirus first detected in Wuhan, China, that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and pneumonia. Covid-19 pneumonia is defined by a positive result for SARS-CoV-2 on a reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay of a specimen collected from the upper or lower respiratory tract together with radiological features of pneumonia and clinical features of hypoxaemia and dyspnoea. Although more than 80% of patients with Covid-19 infection have mild disease and make a full recovery, a significant proportion of patients progress to pneumonia, and about half of these cases will develop severe acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS). Initial reports from China suggested that age >65 years and medical comorbidities are risk factors for poor outcomes.(1) The need for ICU admission and mechanical ventilation once ARDS develops is associated with a high mortality, ranging from 39% to 72%.(2,3) Current guidelines recommend that corticosteroids or immunosuppressive therapy should not be used in patients with Covid-19 pneumonia unless there are other indications, such as shock, asthma or exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.(4) However, the role of systemic corticosteroids is currently being re-evaluated in mechanically ventilated adults with ARDS, with some guidelines now suggesting their use.(5)\nWe describe a case of a patient with Covid-19 infection, progressive pneumonia, development of a hyperinflammatory state and cytokine release syndrome (CRS) who was successfully treated with steroids and tocilizumab.\nIn January 2020, a 53-year-old gentleman with a background of asthma on long-term low dose inhaled corticosteroid inhaler had an acute exacerbation of his asthma in February 2020 triggered by a viral upper respiratory tract infection and acute sinusitis and was managed with bronchodilator nebulization and a 7-day course of oral prednisone 30 mg daily. He made an uneventful recovery and proceeded to travel to Austria on 29 February 2020. During his stay in Austria, he had contact with a Covid-19 positive individual and started developing upper respiratory symptoms on 7 March. On his return to South Africa on 8 March he had a fever, sore throat, dry cough, severe wheezing and worsening dyspnoea. At that stage a commercial test for Covid-19 PCR was not yet available to the private pathology laboratories and blood tests showed a normal full blood count and a C-reactive protein (CRP) of 16 mg/L. He was advised to self-isolate at home and was managed telephonically with bronchodilator nebulization, oral prednisone 30 mg daily for 5 days and paracetamol. By 11 March he was not feeling any better and had ongoing fever and cough. The Covid-19 PCR test had become available at that stage and his initial test with a private pathology laboratory was negative.\nOver the next 3 days his symptoms worsened, and on 16 March he was admitted to hospital to an isolation ward where blood tests showed a lymphopaenia and a rising CRP (Table 1). A high-resolution CT scan of his chest showed bilateral asymmetrical peripheral ground glass infiltrates in a subsegmental distribution, particularly in the lower zones. A repeat Covid-19 PCR swab on this occasion was positive and he was diagnosed with Covid-19 pneumonia. His oxygen saturation was 86% on room air. He was haemodynamically stable and was kept in strict isolation, and <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightgreen; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">treatment<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">usages</span>\n</mark> was commenced with supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula, paracetamol, chloroquine, <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightorange; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">azithromycin<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">chemical</span>\n</mark> and lopinavir/ritonavir. In keeping with national and international guidelines recommending <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightgreen; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">against<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">usages</span>\n</mark> the use of systemic corticosteroids, prednisone was discontinued.\nOver the next 5 days his clinical condition worsened despite antiviral therapy. His biomarkers, including lymphopaenia, CRP, pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (Pro-BNP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimers and ferritin all increased significantly (Table 1). His hypoxaemia worsened and he had increased bilateral chest infiltrates on follow-up radiology (Figure 1). His PaO2:FiO2 ratio decreased to 250. He was diagnosed as having Covid-19 hyperinflammatory syndrome, CRS and ARDS. After a discussion with the team he was treated with tocilizumab 800 mg IV, given as two doses of 400 mg 24 h apart on 23 and 24 March, as well as methylprednisolone 40 mg IV daily for 5 days. Chloroquine dose was <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightgreen; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">reduced<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">usages</span>\n</mark> , and <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightorange; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">azithromycin<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">chemical</span>\n</mark> and lopinavir/ritonavir were discontinued in view of QT prolongation (QTc > 500 ms).\nWithin 24 h following the tocilizumab infusion, there was an improvement in his fever, biomarkers (Table 1) and hypoxaemia. Mechanical ventilation was avoided and he was monitored for another 6 day in the isolation unit. His saturations on room air improved to 90%. He was discharged home on 27 March, where he continued to make an uneventful recovery. Follow-up blood tests as an outpatient showed normalization of his lymphocyte count and CRP (Table 1). His saturations on room air improved to 92%. A repeat nasopharyngeal and throat swab test for Covid-19 on 31 March was negative.\nIt has been postulated that there are three distinct but overlapping phases and pathological subsets of Covid-19 infection and subsequent Covid-19 disease in humans, the first two triggered by the virus itself and the third, by the host response.(6) Treatment recommendations differ depending on the stage of the Covid-19 disease: the viral response phase (about 1–6 days after start of symptoms), the pneumonic phase (about days 6–10) which may progress to acute lung injury and ARDS, and the hyperinflammatory phase which typically occurs after day 8 in a minority of patients. This last phase is associated with worsening ARDS, multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), coagulation abnormalities, myocarditis and death. Patients progressing to this last severe phase of Covid-19 have clinical and laboratory evidence of an exaggerated inflammatory response, similar to the CRS, with persistent fever, worsening ARDS, elevated inflammatory markers and proinflammatory cytokines and MODS.\nThe Covid-19 virus binds to alveolar epithelial cells, activating the innate and adaptive immune systems resulting in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This can lead to the CRS which is characterised by a hyperinflammatory state with raised inflammatory cytokines and biomarkers such as interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, IL-7, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, macrophage inflammatory protein 1-α, tumour necrosis factor-α, CRP, ferritin, Pro-BNP and D-dimer.(7) The clinical picture is one of progressive ARDS and fulminant MODS.\nAlthough corticosteroids are not routinely recommended for the treatment of Covid-19-associated lung injury, CRS immunosuppression with corticosteroids and other therapies is likely to be beneficial. Although there are currently no controlled clinical trials on the use of corticosteroids in Covid-19 patients, several published reports of corticosteroid therapy in severe Covid-19 have shown a shorter duration of supplemental oxygen use, improved radiographic findings and lower mortality in patients with ARDS.(8,9)\nTocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor blocker registered for CRS treatment, is being investigated for the treatment of patients with severe Covid-19, CRS and elevated IL-6 levels. IL-6 plays an important role in CRS and tocilizumab binds specifically to both soluble and membrane-bound IL-6 receptors (sIL-6R and mIL-6R), inhibiting sIL-6R and mIL-6R-mediated signalling. Small observational studies support the concept that tocilizumab may be an effective drug for patients with severe Covid-19 and respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation.(10,11) In a study of 21 patients with Covid-19-related ARDS who received tocilizumab, the ICU mortality was less than 5%, all surviving patients became apyrexial within 72 h, pulmonary infiltrates on follow-up CT scan improved in 90%, hypoxaemia resolved in the majority and 90.5% of patients were discharged from the ICU after a median of 13.5 days.(12) A large randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tocilizumab plus standard of care in hospitalised adult patients with severe Covid-19 pneumonia and ARDS has been being initiated.(13)\nCurrently, tocilizumab is available in South Africa for patients with severe Covid-19 and ARDS under the Monitored Emergency use of Unregistered and Investigational Interventions framework.(14) This requires the treating physician to consult with an expert panel prior to enrolment, detailed patient data collection and ensuring that the patient meets the strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. Other immune modulating agents under investigation include siltuximab (IL-6 inhibitor), bevacizumab (vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor), convalescent plasma from patients who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection and intravenous immune globulin (Polygam).(15,16)\nThis case study also highlights some of the many controversies and complications in managing patients with severe Covid-19:•The use of inhaled or oral corticosteroids as a risk factor for severe Covid-19 is not certain. Individuals taking long-term corticosteroids for chronic conditions such as asthma, allergies and arthritis may be unable to mount an appropriate immune response and are generally considered high risk for severe disease if infected with Covid-19.(17) Corticosteroids can also result in increased viral replication and prolonged viral shedding. Even a short course of oral corticosteroids in the preceding month for an asthma exacerbation, such as in this case study, is a risk factor for ARDS and mechanical ventilation.(18) Conversely, in vitro studies with ciclesonide showed antiviral activity against Covid-19, and there have been reports of clinical effectiveness of inhaled ciclesonide in the treatment of Covid-19.(19) Studies are currently underway to investigate whether inhaled ciclesonide alone, or in combination with hydroxychloroquine, could eradicate SARS-CoV-2 from respiratory tract earlier in patients with mild Covid-19.(20)•Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is not always straightforward. Currently, the gold standard in clinical practice is the detection of Covid-19 RNA by RT-PCR in respiratory tract specimens. Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs are recommended over expectorated or induced sputum. Lower respiratory tract specimens, such as tracheal aspirates or bronchoalveolar lavage in intubated patients may have higher viral loads and be more likely to yield positive tests (up to 95% sensitive) but come with a higher risk of transmission of infection to health-care workers.(21) False-negative tests from upper respiratory specimens have been documented, as with this case study. If initial testing is negative in a patient with risk factors for infection and clinical or radiological features are highly suggestive of Covid-19 or determining the presence of infection is important for further management and infection control, repeat <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightpink; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">testing<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">trials</span>\n</mark> is recommended.•Chloroquine, <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightorange; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">azithromycin<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">chemical</span>\n</mark> and lopinavir/ritonavir can all cause QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia, in particular drug-induced torsades de pointes and sudden cardiac death.(22) Patients treated with any combination of these drugs should have 12–24 hourly ECG with QTc monitoring.

Frequent monitoring of QTc is mandatory and chloroquine should also be discontinued if QTc remains >500 ms. The risk of serious ventricular arrhythmia may be reduced by performing a screening ECG prior to initiation of therapy, inquiring about a personal or family history of QT interval prolongation or sudden unexplained cardiac death, avoiding exposure to other medications known to affect QT interval, and aggressively treating hypocalcaemia, hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia. Hypokalaemia is especially common in patients with Covid-19 and is associated with a poorer prognosis.(23) The correction of hypokalaemia can be challenging due to continuous renal loss of potassium resulting from the degradation of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 by binding of SAR-CoV-2.\n\nThis case study of severe Covid-19 pneumonia and CRS illustrates some of the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges and controversies regarding the management of this novel and complex infection.

We recommend that similar dosages no longer be used for the treatment of severe COVID-19,\" said the authors.\n\"Despite these discouraging findings, several other observations prevent concluding categorically that high-dose chloroquine was toxic and that the likely mechanism was arrhythmogenesis,\" commented Dr Stephen Fihn from the University of Washington, Seattle, USA and colleagues, in an accompanying editorial published in JAMA Network Open.2 \"For the time being, prudent clinicians should discuss with patients and their families, when feasible, the potential risks of this drug and the uncertain benefits before initiating it,\" they said.</br></br>UNKNOWN URL AND TITLE</br></br>To date, there is no effective treatment against the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for the COVID-19 disease. Numerous clinical studies are evaluating the utility of antiviral and immunomodulatory drugs, where antimalarials such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are one of the alternatives studied.1\n\nSo far, clinical experience in the use of HCQ arises mainly from treatment in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), whose long-term effects show multiple benefits. However, high cumulative doses have been associated with serious adverse effects, especially in the retina and myocardium.2\n\nMany healthcare protocols propose the use of HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19.1 However, it is important to consider adverse myocardial effects, such as the development of severe arrhythmias.3, 4\n\nIn the COVID-19 patient, possible cardiac involvement is mainly related to 4 factors: 1) underlying heart disease (often silent in older patients); 2) myocardial involvement caused by the infection and the inflammatory response itself, which leads to myocarditis with elevated troponins; 3) acute toxicity probably associated with the use of antimalarials in high doses, more evident in chloroquine treatments and 4) concomitant use of other treatments that, together with HCQ, prolong the corrected QT interval (QTc), with the risk of serious ventricular arrhythmias.3, 4, 5\n\nIn the absence (pending) of conclusive scientific evidence, what considerations should be taken into account when using HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19? It is necessary to change the way in which HCQ is usually used in patients with SLE, adapting its prescription and control of potential adverse effects to this new therapeutic scenario. The following considerations aim to optimize the HCQ treatment of COVID-19:-When the doctor considers that HCQ can be useful, it should be initiated as early as possible after diagnosing the infection, due to the decrease in viral replication and dissemination demonstrated in vitro and in vivo.1\n-Using HCQ in an acute treatment (5 days), with loading dose (400 mg/every 12 h) the first day and 4 days of maintenance (200 mg/every 12 h), after requesting an informed medical consent (with COVID-19 being an indication not contemplated in the SmPC).-Minimize the risk of prolonged QTc. For this, a baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) must be performed prior to the start of treatment. If the QTc is greater than or equal to 500 ms, HCQ should not be started. If the QTc is less than 470 ms in men or less than 480 ms in women, treatment can be initiated, repeating the ECG in 48 h. If the QTc is greater than or equal to 500 ms or an increase greater than or equal to 60 ms is observed, treatment should be discontinued.4\n-Avoid or discontinue the simultaneous <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightgreen; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">use<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">usages</span>\n</mark> of <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightgreen; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">drugs<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">usages</span>\n</mark> that prolong the QTc, particularly <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightorange; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">azithromycin<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">chemical</span>\n</mark> , clarithromycin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, haloperidol, quetiapine, risperidone, domperidone and ondansetron, among others.4, 5\n-Keep a close watch on potassium, calcium and magnesium levels due to their arrhythmogenic potential, as well as glycemia in patients with diabetes due to the risk of hypoglycaemia.4\n-Consider not administering or discontinuing HCQ in advanced stages of infection due to the possibility of a COVID-19-induced myocarditis.3, 5\n-It is not necessary to adjust the dose based on renal or hepatic function, nor does it require ophthalmological control before or after treatment.6\n-Pending the result of several active studies, HCQ should not be indicated prophylactically as there is no evidence to support its preventive use or post-exposure to avoid COVID-19 infection.\n\nIn short, when prescribing HCQ in COVID-19, different precautions should be taken from those currently considered for SLE patients. It should be indicated in its window of opportunity and consider the existing multifactorial myocardial involvement, seeking to avoid cardiovascular adverse effects. The results of different controlled and randomized studies that confirm or refute the usefulness of HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19 will contribute to define its role in this clinical setting.\nThe authors declare that they have not received funding to carry out this study.</br></br>UNKNOWN URL AND TITLE</br></br>Dear Editor:\nDespite various therapeutic schemes used since the onset of the SARS-CoV2 pandemic of COVID-19, mortality remains around 3–5% in the different countries that have reported cases.1 After the knowledge that the virus enters the cell through the union of its protein S with the receptor for ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme type 2)2 has been speculated with the suspension of certain pharmacological groups that due to their mechanism of action increase the presence of these receptors and therefore could increase the passage of virus into the alveolar cells, this point remaining in controversy. On the other hand, in a recently published retrospective series of cases, a frequent elevation of d-dimer has been observed, which has been related to acute pulmonary thrombosis, which has dramatically worsened the prognosis in this subgroup of patients.3 It is striking that those patients with a higher d-dimer also show more marked desaturations even without observing pneumonia on CTPA (Computarized Tomography Pulmonary Angiography).\nUnlike hemorrhagic viruses (Ebola, Marburg...), SARS-Cov-2 could be a highly prothrombotic virus that causes alterations in the coagulation cascade not well characterized at present that would lead to a progressive elevation of d-dimer in function of the severity and extent of microthrombosis. In turn, this hypothesis could explain that these patients have a clearly worse prognosis since in them, orotracheal intubation would provide oxygen to a lung with no microvascular perfusion due to disseminated microthrombotic disease, which would also only be seen in CTPA in very advanced stages and in which little can be done to reverse this situation.4\n\nGradually a therapeutic scheme is being established that would include hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin5 (or in other cases lopinavir/ritonavir) in the early stages of moderate disease that does not require treatment in ICU (Intensive Care Unit) but given the analytical indication (elevation of d-dimer) and imaging (thrombosis in CTPA) in many cases, should be evaluated the early inclusion of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) at doses of at least high-risk prophylaxis in all these patients without thrombopenia <20,000 platelets or acute bleeding and manifesting high d-dimer. Given the paucity of prospective studies, the need for urgent effective management, and the relative safety of these LMWH doses, the HAH (hydroxychloroquine– <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightorange; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">azithromycin<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">chemical</span>\n</mark> –heparin) <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightgreen; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">regimen<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">usages</span>\n</mark>  <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightblue; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">could<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">ideas</span>\n</mark> be <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightpink; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">tested<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">trials</span>\n</mark> in randomized clinical <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightpink; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">trials<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">trials</span>\n</mark> to improve the evolution of the disease in cases of torpid evolution.</br></br>UNKNOWN URL AND TITLE</br></br>\nAuthor Information\nAn event is serious (based on the ICH definition) when the patient outcome is:* death* life-threatening* hospitalisation* disability* congenital anomaly* other medically important event\n\nIn a single centre, retrospective observational study of 90 patients hospitalised at an institute in USA between 1 March 2020 and 7 April 2020, two patients [ages and sexes not stated] were described, who developed prolongation of QTc interval, torsade de pointes, cardiomyopathy, ventricular arrhythmias, bradycardia or hypoglycaemia during off-label treatment with hydroxychloroquine (1 patient) or during <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightgreen; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">treatment<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">usages</span>\n</mark> with propofol and off-label <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightgreen; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">treatment<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">usages</span>\n</mark> with hydroxychloroquine and <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightorange; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">azithromycin<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">chemical</span>\n</mark> for pneumonia associated with corona virus infection (Covid-19) [not all indications and dosages stated; routes and outcomes not stated].\nCase 1: The patient, who tested positive for Covid-19 associated pneumonia, was hospitalised at an institute in USA and was prescribed off-label treatment with hydroxychloroquine 400mg twice a day on day 1 followed by 400mg daily from day 2.

His initial valproate level was within therapeutic range. Subsequently, metronidazole and meropenem were added due to bacteraemia. Post antibiotics initiation, his valproate level was noted to be markedly reduced, likely due to interaction with meropenem. The dose of valproate was not changed, as the duration of meropenem therapy was short (5 days). ). Upon completion of meropenem therapy, the valproate level normalised.\nCase 2 (68-year-old woman): The woman had generalised anxiety disorder with depressive disorder, and she had been receiving venlafaxine 225 mg/24h for more than 5 years, and trazodone and vortioxetine were added 5 months ago in view of worsening of depressive symptoms.

Its name is attributing to their distinctive shape under the electron microscope examination as they are characterized by possessing spikes like projections on their external surface providing them with a crown-like appearance [1]. Taxonomically, they are members of the subfamily of Orthocoronavirinae, the family of Coronaviridae, the order of Nidovirales. Generally, CoVs are categorized into four main genera including α-/β-/γ-/δ-COV.α- and β-COV have the abilities to infect mammals, whereas γ- and δ-COV can infect birds [2, 3]. Additionally, they have shown a similar ability to infect humans in previous decades [4–9]. Historically, before 2019, six-known human CoVs types were causing respiratory diseases with various severities; four common CoVs types identified as HKU1, NL63, 229E, and OC43; and two highly pathogenic CoVs types identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [10]. For instance, the lethality of CoVs was demonstrated considering the emergence of SARS in 2002 [5] and MERS in 2012 attributing to their rapid spread across intermediary hosts (i.e., bats) [11] up to the final host (i.e., humans) [12, 13]. On December 31, 2019, a series of unexplained 27 pneumonia cases were recorded in Wuhan city, China. Given the commercial nature of Wuhan, as the main transportation center in central China, it is considered one of the most over crowded cities with a population exceeding 11 million [14]. Pathologically, these patients suffered from dry cough, dyspnea, myalgia, fever, and bilateral lung infiltrates. Whereas the less common symptoms are headache, sputum production, hemoptysis, and diarrhea [15]. A temporary name was originally given to this coronavirus as 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and was subsequently named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the Coronaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) [16]. World Health Organization (WHO) named this newly identified flu-like β-coronavirus as COVID-19 and on January 30, 2020 WHO declared that COVID-19 outbreak as “public health emergency of international concern” and a pandemic on March 11 [17, 18]. Until May 8, 2020, a total of 3,759,967 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in globally including 259,474 deaths. Figure 1 presents an illustration of the COVID-19 spread worldwide from 30 December 2019 through May 8, 2020. The major aim of this review is to provide a prompt, and valuable reference guides about COVID-19. Some important questions will be addressed, such as, its origin, transmission, clinical symptoms, diagnosis, environmental aspects, and the possible indoors and outdoors airborne transmission minimization strategies.\nTypically, SARS-CoV comprises four variable types of proteins including spike (S) protein, envelope (E) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, and membrane (M) protein (i.e., accessory proteins, RNA polymerase, papain-like protease, helicase, 3-chymotrypsin-like protease, and glycoprotein) [19] as presented in Fig. 2a. The S protein plays a major role in infecting the host body as it binds with the host’s receptors, reach the target cells, and consequently initiate the infection process. Despite the structural variations of S protein’s amino acids between SARS and COVID-19, the latter can cling to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), representing the same host’s receptors of SARS [20]. Figure 2b shows the linear ssRNA(þ) genome of SARS-CoV2 [21].\nUnfortunately, few studies were published up till now to clarify the pathophysiological characters of COVID-19 and its mysterious spread mechanism. The current exceptions are largely derived from the similar CoVs transmissibility behaviors, which are based on human-to-human transmission scenario [22]. In general, respiratory viruses are most contagious when the patient is symptomatic; however, some studies demonstrate the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission during the asymptomatic incubation period, i.e., between 1 and 14 days [23–25]. The common transmission ways of SARS-CoV-2 include contact transmission (i.e., oral, nasal, and eye mucous membranes), and direct transmission (i.e., cough, sneeze, and droplet inhalation) [26].\nContact transmission can occur by skin-to-skin contact with an infected person, or by touching contaminated items from a patient’s room (i.e., fomites, equipment, telephones, countertops, and bed sheets, etc.). The risk of contact transmission increases if a person exposed to wound drainage, secretions, or fluids (i.e., vomitus, diarrhea, etc.) of an infected person. Some of the notable pathogens transmitted by contact include MRSA, CRE (carbapenem-resistant enterococcus), SARS, and MERS [27].\nDirect Transmission can occur when people with certain infections talk, laugh, cough, sneeze, and/or sing in the presence of others. There are two main types of direct transmission: droplet and airborne [27]. Droplet Transmission occurs when an infected person is coughed, sneezed, or spoken, which in turn creates contaminated droplets that can reach other persons’ eyes, nose, and/or mouth. These droplets are quite large, not long suspended in the air and settle down rather fast [28]. Simply placing a disposable mask on the patient reduces infection transmission to healthcare workers [29]. Droplet-borne diseases are influenza, meningococcal disease, mycoplasma, whooping cough, rubella, and mumps [27]. Airborne Transmission refers to situations where small droplets and/or dust particles containing the pathogen may remain suspended in the air for long (2 h or more) and can travel a much greater distance from the patient [28]. Furthermore, the samples of conjunctiva obtained from confirmed and suspected COVD-19 cases showed that its spread is not limited to the respiratory tract [30]. Eye exposure may be considered as a way of getting infected with viruses as well [31]. Other study stated that the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 to transmit directly and/or indirectly through saliva during medical procedures [32]. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in fecal swabs of patients, indicating the possibility of fecal–oral route transmission [33–35]. The risk related to dental care settings is invariably not less than the mentioned routes referring to its procedures specificity involving face-to-face communication with patients and frequent contact with saliva, blood, and other fluids [36–38]. Figure 3 shows a hypothesized origin of the virus and a generalized path of transmission of the epidemic zoonotic coronavirus.\nFirst of all, the proper identifying of a suspected COVID-19 case represents a suitable route to distinguish between doubt and certainty. If anyone has fears to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, the first thing they should do is to go the nearest local health care center where the medical representative should do the following scenario; the body temperature should be examined by a contact-free forehead thermometer. Then, a questionnaire should be given to the patient, which would include some typical questions like the following: (1) In the past fortnight, did you have or experience a fever? (2) Have you recently experienced respiratory problems, such as a cough or difficulty in breathing within the past fortnight? (3) In the past fortnight, have you travelled to Wuhan city or its surroundings, or visited any area with documented COVID-19 transmission? (4) Have you physically contacted with a COVID-19 patient within the past fortnight? (5) In the past fortnight, have you physically contacted with people who come from Wuhan city or its surroundings, or people from areas with recently documented fever or respiratory problems? (6) In the past fortnight, were there at least two people with documented experience of fever or respiratory problems having close contact with you? (7) Have you recently attended meetings, gatherings, or had close contact with many people? [26]. The body temperature will be the controlling parameter in these conditions. If a person replies “yes” to any question and their body temperature is below 37.3 °C, the physician can postpone the treatment until 14 days after the exposure. The person should be instructed to self-quarantine at home and report any fever experience to the local health department. If a person replies “yes” to question and their body temperature is over 37.3 °C, they should be immediately quarantined. If a person replies “no” to all questions, and their body temperature is below 37.3 °C, the physician can treat them with extra-protection measures and avoids spatter or aerosol-generating procedures to the best [26].\nThe Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the World Health Organization (WHO) have distributed a brief on important clinical conclusions regarding the SARS-CoV-2 infection [39] (Table 1). The clinical symptoms include dry cough, diarrhea, vomiting, fever, and myalgia. Some patients may have other complications including; acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute heart injury, and secondary infection with bacteria [15]. However, cases may be asymptomatic or even without fever [40]. Based on 1099 cases, Guan et al. [41] team found that the common clinical signs included headache (13.6%), sore throat (13.9%), shortness of breath (18.6%), sputum production (33.4%), fatigue (38.1%), cough (67.8%), and fever (88.7%). These findings have been supported by a meta-analysis study involved 3600 patients and found that fever (83.3%), cough (60.3%), and fatigue (38.0%) were the most common clinical symptoms [42]. Furthermore, a number of patients had gastrointestinal symptoms, with vomiting (5.0%), and diarrhea (3.8%). The clinical signs matched the data of 41.99 patients in Hubei province. Cough and fever were the main signs, while gastrointestinal signs were rare, reflecting the differences in the virus tropism compared to SARS, MERS, and influenza [43]. Cases of aged people and those with chronic disorders like diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were quickly developed into acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulation dysfunction, leading to unavoidable death [30].\nThe Institute of Virology in China has done preliminary classification of the SARS-CoV-2 through Koch’s postulates and observed its morphology through electron microscopy [14]. When the SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequence was published, the national laboratory networks in Japan, Singapore, and Hong Kong initiated diagnostic tests [44]. The clinical diagnostic method known so far is nucleic acid detection in the throat and nasal swab sampling by real-time PCR [3]. Patients with suspected infection may present an elevated C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine, prolonged prothrombin time, and lymphopenia has been associated with severe cases. Additionally, chest X-ray (CXR) imaging generally shows bilateral infiltrates, ground glass opacities in the lungs of infected patients [45]. Furthermore, the full genomic sequencing from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid can confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection [46]. Efforts are still exerted to reach a vaccine that is hoped to be an essential tool to contain this epidemic [47].\nGuangdong Second Provincial General Hospital plans to integrate artificial intelligence image recognition in order to improve the accuracy of immediate detection [48]. Moreover, Chinese experts relied on the IoT-aided diagnosis. The ultimate goal is to diagnose COVID-19 at an early stage and to improve its treatment by applying medical technology. This could help in reducing disease transmission and physician infection [49].\nTo confront this sudden public health crisis, and to reduce the complications and death rate, CDC and WHO have pointed out guiding advice on preventing further spread of COVID-19 [50, 51]. Basically, the CDC defines standard precautions as common-sense utilization of practices, and personal protective equipment (PPE) to seize the spread of infection. These practices include proper patient isolation, cough etiquette, proper handling and cleaning of patient equipment, laundry, and so forth [50]. Basic hygiene measures are highly recommended as well, like frequent hand washing and the use of PPE such as face masks (N95 and 3M respirators) [52]. Systematically, we can divide the prevention plan into three stages to reduce the risk of the new COVID-19 as follow [52, 53]:(i)Reducing the danger of transmission from the natural host. This necessitates more awareness of the natural environment of the virus. Similarly, it is important to consider transmission dangers when new interactions occur, e.g., when human residences extend into bat habitats. Finally, important social measures are conveying the message to the public that interactions with bats should be avoided (based on disease ecology knowledge).(ii)Reducing the danger of transmission from the intermediate host. Basically, such danger could be evaded through entirely isolating bats away from the intermediate host. However, this may be more or less difficult based on the virus intermediate hosts(s). Live-animal markets play a central role in this route, and they need to be strictly addressed. However, the cultural context of these markets should be wisely considered.(iii)Reducing the human-to-human transmission. This is obviously a vital measure to seize the current outbreak.\nWhile much can be collected from our general understanding of corona virus biology and some early studies on SARS-CoV-2, many pertinent questions still exist, which will be outlined here.\nThe international response of governments across the globe has adopted extreme procedures to curb the outbreak of COVID-19. First, travel restrictions to China were declared, and people returning/evacuated from China were being examined, isolated, and tested for COVID-19 for 2 weeks [22]. With the rapid spread of the virus globally, these travel restrictions have been extended to other countries as well [1]. For instance, Italy, Greece, and the Czech Republic have recently suspended issuing visas [54]. US airlines have suspended their flights till early spring as well [55]. The WHO is currently recommending local exit screening by healthcare professionals at airports [56]. Several countries worldwide (Australia, Thailand, Japan, India, Italy, UK, USA, and Singapore) have initiated temperature and symptom screening protocols and quarantining citizens who have been recently evacuated from Wuhan [57–60]. Additionally, some countries have banned public gatherings to seize the spread of the virus. France has banned crowds of more than 1000 to contain coronavirus [61], and Saudi Arabia has temporarily stopped religious pilgrims (both foreign and local) from visiting Mecca and Medina [62]. Spain and Italy have declared the entire country in quarantine; travel and all commercial activities have been halted, except for pharmacies and food shops [63]. Germany has closed its borders in coordination with other EU countries. Canada has enacted varying measures; Alberta had indefinitely closed child daycares and schools, and Quebec had announced the closure of all public and private entertainment facilities, while Ontario banned jail visits and postponed court trials. Iran has released 85,000 prisoners as a precautionary measure [64].\nOther countries have fought back coronavirus without such strict procedures. South Korea, for instance, has reported confirmed infections decrease from 909 persons on February 29–74 on March 16. The success of their strategy relied on a well-structured testing process, along with exerted efforts to separate infected people, trace their contacts, and quarantine them. By March 16, South Korea had tested more than 270,000 persons [65].\nThe Egyptian government hastened the exerted efforts to curb the spread of the virus. The authorities have declared a nationwide curfew from 7 p.m. till 6 a.m., and the suspension of all governmental services except for health care services [66]. In mid-March, Egypt suspended international flights to and from the country and returned Egyptians locked in other countries who could not return home after imposing the travel ban. Those who returned were quarantined to protect them, their families, and the society at large. The authorities also closed schools and universities, banned mass gatherings, and temporarily paused communal prayers at mosques and churches [67].\nIn less than a 2-week period, a 1 billion Chinese finance fund was used to build two new hospitals in Wuhan [68]. The EU collected a €10,000,000 research fund to contribute to more efficient clinical management of infected patients [69]. Some important medical companies, such as, Co-Diagnostics, the Novacyt’s molecular diagnostics division, and Primerdesign Ltd., have launched COVID-2019 testing kits for use in the research studies [70, 71]. In order to help in the development of vaccine, the UK government has assigned a budget of £20,000,000 [72].\nThe Egyptian government has followed a number of procedures, such as the allocation of EGP 1 billion to finance the COVID-19 response plan, as well as sending medical aids and food to a number of countries haunted by the pandemic, like Italy, China, Lebanon, and the Gaza Strip [67].\nIn the absence of a specific <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightgreen; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">antiviral<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">usages</span>\n</mark>  <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightgreen; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">drug<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">usages</span>\n</mark> , anecdotal <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightgreen; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">use<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">usages</span>\n</mark> of <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightgreen; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">drugs<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">usages</span>\n</mark> like protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, and <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightorange; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">azithromycin<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">chemical</span>\n</mark> as an RNA polymerase inhibitor as well as remdesivir, favipiravir, ribavirin, and interferon-1 beta has been reported. The other antibiotics worth mentioning are glycopeptides and teicoplanin which were used to prevent the entry of Ebola envelope pseudo-typed viruses into the cytoplasm. These antibiotics have an inhibitory effect on transcription/replication of competent virus-like particles with low micromolar range [73]. SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding site has a strong affinity with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and using inhibitors of the rennin angiotensin system may have a great role in treating severe respiratory disease [74, 75]. Similarly, zinc nanoparticles were shown to have inhibitory effects on H1N1; however, their effect on COVID-19 still needs more evaluation [76]. Vitamin C supplementation has some role in the prevention of pneumonia; yet, its effect on COVID-19 is still unknown [77]. Furthermore, the usage of traditional Chinese herbs has been recommended in the Chinese guidelines [47]. It has been reported that Ivermectin, a previously FDA-approved anti-parasitic drug, can act as an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro in Vero-hSLAM cells. Thus, Ivermectin needs further research on possible benefits in vivo [78]. However, more clinical studies are still required before these drugs are used in the battle against SARS-CoV-2. As a last resort, Convalescent plasma—or immunoglobulins—has been used to improve the survival rate of patients with deteriorated conditions [79]. Probably, this is because the immunoglobulin antibodies in the plasma of patients recovering from viral infection might suppress viremia [73].\nTo prevent the transmission of the infection to others, and to ensure the continuity of care-providing, it is fundamental to protect healthcare workers. Other transmission modes, such as airborne, are likely given the virus is found in higher concentrations in the lungs than the upper respiratory tract [80]. Therefore, gasmasks were recommended during the 2002–2003 outbreak of SARS [81].\nDroplet particles are larger than those exhibiting airborne transmission; thus, keeping a distance of at least 6 feet away from the patient may be sufficient. Though negative pressure rooms are not necessary, patients should be quarantined in single rooms. The surfaces and equipment should be decontaminated regularly. Airborne transmission safety measures should be followed during aerosol-generating processes [1]. A recent study stated the presence of coronavirus in anal swabs from infected patients, and the possibility of transmission through the fecal–oral route [35]. Therefore, personal protective equipment (PPE), including N95 respirators, protective suits, goggles, gloves, caps, and face shields, should be offered to medical staff and healthcare providers who are working at the frontlines [27].\nVulnerable healthcare ancillary staff (such as nursing assistants, cleaners, food service workers, ambulance drivers, medics, and techs/aids who help move patients onto stretchers) should wear all the above-recommended PPE [27].\nIntra-hospital and inter-hospital transfer of patients may be required; therefore, accompanying staff must wear PPE [82]. In addition, clinicians should exercise caution if an aerosol-generating procedure, such as bag valve mask (BVM) ventilation, oropharyngeal suctioning, endotracheal intubation, or nebulizer treatment is necessary [27]. Though a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patient is rare to be treated in the dental clinic, the dentist, who by default cannot avoid close contact with the infected patient, should wear special protective attire. In addition to the PPE, a coat with extra one-use protective clothing, disposable doctor cap, and impermeable shoe cover should be worn [26].\nGuangdong Second Provincial General Hospital outlined an advanced infection control system to provide real-time monitoring and to avoid nosocomial infection [83]. All infection control observers have been trained to become familiar with the infection-control requirements in the isolation zones. They monitor medical staff in the actual time via computer monitors in a separate area using cameras that cover the entire zone except for the privacy area. The main responsibilities of the observer are to maintain the operation of the isolation zones, supervise the procedure of disinfection, ensure a sufficient supply of protective supplies, prepare specimens for examination and observe the care provider during treating patients and also while wearing or taking the PPE off when entering or leaving the zone [48].\nThe analysis of the genetic material of COVID-19 virus in wastewater could give warning of an epidemic outbreak. Recent analysis carried out by Water Quality and Health Department of the Italian National Institute of Health (ISS) examined eight samples of wastewater collected from February 3 to 28 in Milan and from March 31 to April 2 in Rome [87]. The presence of COVID-19 RNA has been confirmed in two of the sewage system samples collected in the western and central-eastern area of Milan. While the integrated water cycle, which includes water purification and sewage, is certainly safe and controlled for this virus and other pathogens as stated in a recent ISS report, the presence of COVID-19 in wastewater has made it possible to use urban sewage systems as a noninvasive tool for early detection of virus spread [84].\nIn Paris, on April 19, traces of COVID-19 were found in the non-drinkable street cleaning water. Time course quantitative analysis (PCR) was performed in 23 raw and eight treated wastewater samples from three major treatment plants, from 5 March to 7 April 2020 [88]. All raw wastewater samples proved positive for SARS-CoV-2, as did six of eight samples from treated wastewater. The viral load of treated wastewater was 100 times less than that of raw wastewater. Drinking water, separately treated, had no traces of the virus [88]. These data confirm that WBE has the potential to be applied to SARS-CoV-2 as a sensitive tool to study spatial and temporal trends of virus circulation in the population.\nThis environmental surveillance data can be compared to declare COVID-19 cases at municipality level, revealing that members of the community were shedding SARS-CoV-2 RNA in their stool even before the first cases were reported by local or national authorities in many of the cities where wastewaters have been sampled. The estimated viral RNA copy numbers observed in the wastewater can be used to estimate the number of infected individuals in the catchment via Monte Carlo simulation.\nThe WBE approach to testing for COVID-19 has potential advantages over testing the public. First, virus concentrations in wastewater represent the overall status of the watershed, while the number of COVID-19 cases involving infected people is possibly biased. Testing of the public seldom involves complete enumeration or even randomized sampling, because these sampling methods tend to overwhelm or collapse the medical care system, have the disadvantage of false-positives, and are time and labor intensive. The WBE approach is effective in identifying temporal changes in the infection status in the watershed without selection bias. Its second advantage relates to the issue of the stigma that can result from an outbreak. Infected people, or those diagnosed with a false-positive, together with their families, are potentially harmed by stigma and discrimination as well as social isolation [89]. Moreover, WBE minimizing domino effects such as unnecessarily long stay-at-home policies that stress humans and economies alike. WBE measures chemical signatures in sewage, such as fragment biomarkers from the severe acute respiratory syndrome from SARS-CoV-2, simply by applying the type of clinical diagnostic testing (designed for individuals) to the collective signature of entire communities.\nThe disadvantages of WBE approach are incomplete enumeration or randomized sampling of the entire population. So far, WBE may not have been preferred due to potential regional stigma; however, WBE has proved its value by avoiding individual stigmatization. By contrast, in the current context of a worldwide outbreak of COVID-19, details of the number of cases in a particular region, and sometimes identifying details of infected individuals, are already being broadcast.\nThe effect of weather on COVID-19 spread is poorly understood. Recently, few studies have claimed that warm weather may possibly slowdown the global pandemic.\nIt is essential to know the environmental parameters within which the severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS-CoV-2. The results of Huang et al. (2020) showed that 60.0% of the confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 occurred in places where the air temperature ranged from 5 to 15 °C, with a peak in cases at 11.54 °C [90]. Moreover, approximately 73.8% of the confirmed cases were concentrated in regions with absolute humidity of 3 to 10 g/m3. SARS-CoV-2 appears to be spreading toward higher latitudes. These findings suggest that there is an optimal climatic zone in which the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 markedly increases in the ambient environment (including the surfaces of objects). These results strongly imply that the COVID-19 pandemic may spread cyclically and outbreaks may recur in large cities in the mid-latitudes in autumn 2020 [90].\nBiktasheva proposed that a habitat’s air humidity negatively correlate with Covid-19 morbidity and mortality and supported this hypothesis on the example of publicly available data from German federal states [91].\nInhaling small airborne droplets is probable as a route of infection, in addition to more widely recognized transmission via larger respiratory droplets and direct contact with infected people or contaminated surfaces [92]. While uncertainties remain regarding the relative contributions of the different transmission pathways, we argue that existing evidence is strong enough to warrant engineering controls aimed at airborne transmission as part of a comprehensive indoor infection risk reduction strategy. Suitable building engineering controls include adequate and effective ventilation, possibly enhanced by particulate filtration and air disinfection, avoiding recirculation of air and avoiding overcrowding. These interventions can also be introduced quickly and at no expense, but only if they are regarded as important in contributing to the objectives of infection control. We believe that the use of engineering controls in public buildings, including hospitals, schools, restaurants, kindergartens, shops, libraries, offices, conference, cruise ships, elevators, rooms or public transport, in parallel with the effective application of other controls (including isolation and quarantine, social distance, and hygiene of hands) would be an additional significant global measure to reduce the risk of transmission and thereby shielding healthcare staff, patients, and the general public.\nGovernments and public health authorities alone cannot succeed in combating the outbreak. People need to protect themselves and others from COVID-19 by following public health advice, adopting the suggested preventive measures, and complying with the guidance issued by health authorities [63]. Testing and isolating of the infected and their recent contacts are considered one way to solve the problem of the outbreak. The population should be properly educated of who to isolate themselves to help them to deal with the matter when got infected [65]. In addition to the exerted efforts to battle the disease, special attention should be paid to the mental health issues of the community. Screening of psychiatric disorders including anxiety, depression, and mental stress among patients and the medical staffs are vital to ensure the stable psychological status quo [93]. Governments should provide health care services to patients without health insurance benefits. The government can create a hotline for citizens to report suspected coronavirus cases and to provide medical advice via specialized doctors for non-emergency cases. Community organizations that deal with anyone experiencing food, medication, or housing insecurity should receive additional governmental support. Employment rights, including paid sick-leave policies, should be applied for the individuals who act in the interest of communal health to support themselves and their families [94].\nCompared with the SARS outbreak, the international response to COVID-19 was more straightforward and effective. However, some learnings points should be taken into consideration in case of future COVID-19 outbreaks (Table 2).\nIn the last 3 months, a viral infectious disease namely COVID-19 has emerged and quickly spread all over the world. It is a fatal disease that is turned out to be a massive load on the global health systems. COVID-19 infection is not limited to vulnerable persons (i.e., children, health care providers, and the elderly), but it can infect the youth as well. Therefore, combating this epidemic requires robust and rigorous protocols to curb its accelerated transmission. Considering the absence of an approved and effective vaccine for COVID-19 up till now, epidemiological changes, such as, transmissibility, pathogenicity, phylogeny, clinical manifestation, diagnosis, and fatality rate, should be cautiously observed. Most of the countries around the world have adopted effective control and preventive measures, like stopping domestic and international flights, and nationwide curfew, so as to face the viral spread. To sum up, with the current status of this pandemic, more scientific investigations are carried out to reduce its deadly consequences. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater in early stages of the spread of COVID-19 highlights the relevance Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) approach as an early indicator of the infection within a specific population. International cooperation between environmental researchers, wastewater workers, and public health specialists is suggested, aimed at preventing the spread of COVID-19. Surprisingly, this tool has not been widely embraced by epidemiologists or public health officials.</br></br>UNKNOWN URL AND TITLE</br></br>Macrolide antibiotics can be used for the treatment of a wide variety of bacterial infections.

Initially, he received interferon-β-1a [interferon-β1a], which was switched to dimethyl-fumarate in 2015 due to lack of efficacy. In October 2019, he started receiving natalizumab [route and dosage not stated] due to clinical and radiological activity of multiple sclerosis. His neurological examination showed only minimal signs and Expanded Disability Status Scale score was 1.5. At the end of March 2020, his mother showed symptoms of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). He was asymptomatic. Considering the risk of multiple sclerosis rebound following the discontinuation of natalizumab, natalizumab was administered on 30 March 2020. On 2 April 2020, he presented with cough, malaise and fever. Chest x-ray showed bilateral ground glass opacities, consistent with viral pneumonia. Blood test showed a slight elevation in CRP and fibrinogen levels; however, interleukin-6 was found to be low.

He did not stabilise despite treatment with atropine, epinephrine [adrenaline] and norepinephrine [noradrenaline]. Thereafter, following several investigations, he was additionally diagnosed with pulmonary embolism. Therefore, he underwent catheter guided fibrinolysis at right pulmonary artery with alteplase [Actilyse] 10mg injection, followed by thrombectomy in the right pulmonary artery. A large amount of thrombus was removed from the left pulmonary artery. For the remaining thrombus, he was given an injection of alteplase 18mg followed by thrombectomy. Subsequently, he improved, but during subsequent thrombectomy, he developed supraventricular tachycardia which did not respond to adenosine 12mg along with haemodynamic impairment. This led to interruption of thrombectomy. For haemodynamic stabilisation, removal of the trans valvar vascular sheath was required and at last inferior vena cava was deployed. He was then taken back to the ICU and thrombolytic treatment was maintained with low dose of alteplase (50mg in 1 hour).

He started receiving immunosuppressive therapy with prednisone 100mg, mycophenolate mofetil 2000mg daily and tacrolimus. The dosage of mycophenolate mofetil was subsequently tapered to 1000 mg daily, and then to 500 mg daily. His immediate postoperative course was complicated by delayed graft function of his kidney. Therefore, he received dialysis on postoperative day (POD) 3 for progressive hyperkalaemia in the setting of oliguria. His sternal and kidney wounds were found to be infected with MRSA and Corynebacterium species.\nThe man was treated with unspecified antibiotics. On POD 22, haemodialysis was stopped with a creatinine of 2.4 mg/dL. In the following week, his ureteral stent was removed in a routine office visit. A couple of days later, he presented with lower abdominal pain, and his creatinine level was found to be elevated from a urinoma. Wound drainage was performed and a percutaneous nephrostomy tube (PNT) was placed. Subsequently, a transplant kidney biopsy revealed acute tubular necrosis without rejection. On POD 36, chest X-ray showed some mild central vascular prominence, a left pleural effusion but no consolidation. On POD 50, he was hospitalised for fever and leucocytosis. A CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis revealed left pleural effusion without any focal consolidation. On POD 57, chest X-ray showed interval progression of interstitial pulmonary oedema with increasing left small pleural effusion. The perinephric collection showed growth of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) and blood cultures showed MRSA bacteraemia. Additionally, he developed a low-grade BK polyoma virus DNAaemia. His lymphocyte count was found to be increased than 3 weeks before. He started receiving unspecified antibiotics. The dose of prednisone was reduced to 5mg daily, tacrolimus dose was reduced to trough goal of 5-8 µg/mL and mycophenolate mofetil was discontinued. In view of worsening fluid overload and diuretic resistance, continuous venovenous hemodialysis was initiated. Considering his aspiration event, he required an emergent endotracheal intubation. On POD 60, he was successfully weaned from ventilatory support. Sputum culture showed presence of Klebsiella pneumonia, Morganella morganii, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. On POD 77, based on chest X-ray findings, left lower lobe ventilator-associated pneumonia was suspected, and he received unspecified treatment. Subsequently, a low-grade BK polyoma virus DNAaemia worsened. In the setting of weak respiratory drive and failure to thrive from worsening malnutrition, he developed respiratory distress and respiratory failure which required re-intubation in the next week. Thereafter, his initial ventilator settings were weaned down rapidly to minimal support. In view of his persistent cough, weak respiratory drive, recurrent aspirations and malnutrition, an elective tracheostomy was planned to assist with rehabilitation. Prior to surgery, a routine SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test (NAT) was found to be positive for COVID-19 infection.

He did not report any other symptoms. He had undergone third kidney transplantation in 2016 and received induction immunosuppression with antithymocyte globulin [thymoglobulin], everolimus, unspecified steroids and tacrolimus. Further, his immunosuppression was maintained with tacrolimus, everolimus and prednisone 5mg once a day. Concurrently, he was on losartan for arterial hypertension. Due to signs of mild dehydration, he was treated with oral hydration and eventually discharged with a presumptive diagnosis of non-severe viral gastroenteritis with paracetamol. Five days later, he returned to the ER with persistent fever and productive cough without GI symptoms. Physical examination demonstrated a body temperature 37.4°C, BP 180/100mm Hg, pulse 66 beats/minute, RR 16 breaths/minute and blood oxygen saturation 98% on room air. He also had signs of mucous dehydration and crackles in the right lower lung along with signs of left eye conjunctivitis. Heart examination did not describe murmurs, rubs or gallops. Laboratory findings showed WBC count 10.15 × 109/L (total lymphocyte count 1.8 × 109 U/L), platelet count of 126 × 109/L and CRP level 13.2 mg/dL.

Due to the interaction of ritonavir and tacrolimus, his tacrolimus therapy was stopped. Everolimus was also discontinued due to the risk for mTOR-inhibitor induced pneumonitis. He also received empiric broad spectrum antibiotics. Further, oral off-label therapy with hydroxychloroquine 400mg twice a day for 24h and afterwards 200mg twice a day was initiated. After 10 days from the initial symptoms and 72h after the off-label anti-viral therapies, he exhibited a worsening in respiratory symptoms with hypoxia despite the use of high-flux nasal oxygen delivery, and he was diagnosed with respiratory failure. He received norepinephrine. Chest X-ray showed a progression to diffuse bilateral infiltrates. Off-label therapy with SC interferon-β 250µg every 48h was started. On day 6, he was intubated with ventilatory supportive care using high positive end-respiratory pressure (PEEP) was provided.

Also, due to suspicion of mechanical ventilation related pneumonia and worsening of WBC count, additional antibiotic therapy was started with meropenem 1000mg 8/8hs [Meronem], cotrimoxazole [Bactrim; sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim 400mg/80mg] 1.5 ampule 8/8hs for 10 days. After that, he underwent tracheostomy, and haemodialysis was initiated with recovery of renal function. He exhibited good recovery and the possibility of spontaneous breathing. At this time, the previously ongoing immunosuppressants and enoxaparin sodium 60 mg/day were re-started. However, persistent oral lesions were noted despite treatment with fluconazole and nystatin [exact duration of treatment to reaction onset not stated]. Eventually, on day 24 of hospitalisation (24 April 2020), dentists were consulted due to persistent white plaque on the tongue dorsum. During examinations, the dentists also noted multiple pinpoint yellowish ulcers on the tongue dorsum resembling the late stage of herpetic recurrent oral lesions. Additionally, a nodule was located on the lower lip that was around 1cm in diameter, consistent with possible reactive lesion fibroma (confirmed with his pre-existing conditions). The tongue scrape culture showed Saccharomyces cerevisiae. His saliva was extremely viscous.\nThe man's antifungal therapy (fluconazole and nystatin) were continued. He was also prescribed chlorhexidine digluconate alcohol-free mouth rinse and daily application of hydrogen peroxide. He was also instructed to maintain oral hygiene. After 2 weeks, the white lesions on the tongue dorsum improved. During repeat intraoral examinations, asymptomatic severe geographic tongue was noted. After ICU discharge, a prompt recovery was noted in his symptoms. His ongoing antibiotics were also stopped and oxygen requirement decreased. On 14 May 2020, he was discharged from the hospital (after 44 days of hospital stay). After 10 days (25 May 2020), he sent an intra oral image that showed improvement in the geographic tongue with slightly erythematous area near the right palentine tonsil, but he was asymptomatic.

In Spain, according to the 14th May 2020 update from the Ministry of Health, there have been 228,540 cases, with a total of 27,321 deaths.\nAlthough the severity of the infection is mainly determined by the development of severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress, other conditions have been described in different organs and systems. Vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain are common digestive system-related symptoms1. Liver involvement is also common2. We report a case of acute pancreatitis that could be related to COVID-19 infection.\nA 76 year-old woman, ex-smoker, with low-risk alcohol consumption (10 g of pure alcohol, one day a week).

She came to the hospital for an 8 h-history of epigastric pain, radiated to both hypochondriac regions, accompanied by vomiting. Approached as possible acute pancreatitis, it was confirmed by high levels of plasma amylase (3,568 IU/L) and compatible abdominal ultrasound, without cholelithiasis. The rest of the laboratory parameters were normal, except for a slight increase of neutrophils (84%) and C-reactive protein (1.9 mg/dL). An abdominal CT confirmed the diagnosis and classified it as interstitial oedematous pancreatitis. A subsequent CT and magnetic resonance cholangiography showed similar findings and again ruled out biliary pathology. The PCR was positive for COVID-19, with symptoms of fever and diarrhoea.

This involvement is pathophysiologically consistent, as the pancreas expresses the angiotensin-converting enzyme, whose receptors facilitate the penetration of the virus4. One case of acute pancreatitis attributable to COVID-19 infection has been described5, with compatible symptoms and CT scans, although no laboratory tests were available to demonstrate high levels of amylase. The patient had been diagnosed with COVID-19 infection and had received treatment with vancomycin and tetracycline, showing the symptoms compatible with acute pancreatitis 5 days after discharge. The latter antibiotic has also been linked to the development of acute pancreatitis3.</br></br>UNKNOWN URL AND TITLE</br></br>In this issue of Heart Rhythm, we continue this quarterly feature highlighting developments and advances in quality improvement in the delivery of heart rhythm care. The current issue focuses on quality improvement surrounding the challenges created for heart rhythm care during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.\nRestructuring Electrophysiology During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Practical Guide From a New York City Hospital Network\nRubin, et al. (Crit Pathw Cardiol 2020 Apr 27 : 10.1097. PMID: 32324622)1 reported on the experiences from 4 different electrophysiology programs in a large New York City hospital network during the time that New York was the global epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. They describe their successful implementation of the HRS/ACC/AHA COVID-19 practice guidance2 and other critical changes to their practice. Providing a pathway for other centers, they describe 7 key steps for strategic implementation including (1) acknowledging that a public health crisis has arrived, (2) determining what urgent electrophysiologic procedures are possible, (3) optimizing staff deployment to minimize exposure and preserve personal protective equipment, (4) coordinating with other clinical sections, EP groups, and hospitals, (5) developing strategic plan for management of inpatient consultations, (6) establishing telemedicine, and (7) planning administrative restructuring. They described their “ramp-down” including a reduction in laboratory case volume in 80%–95% following implementation of a policy to perform procedures only in patients felt to have a likelihood of significant clinical deterioration within a short period of time (i.e. 48 hours to 1–2 weeks). The authors also share their pearls regarding specific patient management including the challenges encountered in the implementation of telehealth. They also describe the use of remote inpatient consultation and telemetry for QTc determinations in COVID positive patients, performing generator change within 1 month after the onset of elective replacement indicator (ERI), and prioritization of same day discharges whenever possible. Based upon their experience, the authors conclude and emphasize the need for proactive planning during a pandemic, including the importance of developing contingency plans before the COVID-19 pandemic reaches a hospital system. They also emphasize the importance of streamlining care and mobilization of resources necessary for transitioning to telemedicine in the midst of a pandemic.\n\nInpatient Use of Ambulatory Telemetry Monitors for COVID-19 Patients <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightgreen; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">Treated<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">usages</span>\n</mark> with Hydroxychloroquine and/or <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightorange; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">Azithromycin<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">chemical</span>\n</mark> \nChang et al (J Am Coll Cardiol 2020;75:2992-7.

The authors conclude that while mobile cardiac outpatient telemetry has not been approved for QTc monitoring for patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter, QRS duration >160 msec, or T-wave <5% of the peak QRS amplitude, their single-center study suggests that innovative management of QTc monitoring is possible under the resource-constrained conditions of a pandemic.\n</br></br>UNKNOWN URL AND TITLE</br></br>\nAuthor Information\nAn event is serious (based on the ICH definition) when the patient outcome is:* death* life-threatening* hospitalisation* disability* congenital anomaly* other medically important event\n\nA 26-year-old man developed myelosuppression, febrile neutropenia and COVID-19 infection during treatment with etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and rituximab for primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma.\nThe man presented with a large mediastinal mass and was diagnosed with primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma. Subsequently, he received 2 cycles of dose-adjusted DA-EPOCH-R regimen consisting etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and rituximab [routes and dosages not stated] and during each of the cycles, he developed febrile neutropenia. On 09 January 2020, he was admitted for the administration of the third cycle of DA-EPOCH-R regimen. Investigations demonstrated partial remission. Subsequently, he received the 3rd cycle of DA-EPOCH-R regimen from 12 January 2020 to 17 January 2020. On 19 January 2020, he had a fever without dyspnea, cough, myalgia or fatigue. His lymphocyte count was 0.68 × 109 cells/L, neutrocyte count 0.89 x 109 cells/L and chest CT revealed no evidence of infection. He received treatment for febrile neutropenia with meropenem, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and linezolid. However, his fever persisted and he had grade 3/4 neutropenia from 21 January 2020 to 25 January 2020. He also exhibited myelosuppression. On further evaluation, he was confirmed positive for antibodies of Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgM, coxsackie B5 virus IgM and enterovirus RNA, indicating infections by these pathogens.\nThe man was <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightgreen; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">treated<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">usages</span>\n</mark> with ganciclovir, <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightorange; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">azithromycin<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">chemical</span>\n</mark> , oseltamivir and posaconazole.

MUII, a partnership between Uganda’s leading health research institute (UVRI) and the country’s oldest and most prestigious university (Makerere University), collaborates with University of Cambridge, the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and other partners, and is currently funded through the African Academy of Sciences’ DELTAS Africa Initiative\n1,\n2. MUII aims to provide opportunities to bright young Ugandans to engage in Africa-led world-class research in I&I to provide solutions for Africa’s health challenges, and to contribute to improving global health. The current COVID-19 global crisis underscores the need for local expertise and infrastructure to support national responses to global health challenges within the local context.\nMUII supports graduate training (master’s and doctoral students) and early career scientists (post-doctoral and group leaders) in I&I disciplines. In addition, MUII provides placements for undergraduate and new-graduate interns, including proactive support for individuals with disability, to develop interest and participate in biomedical research.\nUnlike recent large-capacity building programmes that have focused on increasing the numbers and quality of medical graduates to support health care in resource-limited settings\n3,\n4, MUII supports development of local research scientists to harness cutting edge tools of immunology, molecular biology, genetics and bioinformatics to address the health challenges of tropical Africa\n1,\n2. Although PhD training has increased in the last decade through various collaborative programmes\n5, there is limited experience and data on growth of academic careers from PhD graduates to independent scientists and leaders in science, policy and practice. This gap is emphasised by the scarcity of post-doctoral and research fellow positions in the establishment of several academic institutions in Uganda and the sub-Saharan region. We therefore found it necessary to systematically investigate and document the drivers of the success, the challenges and the key lessons from MUII that might be useful to other research capacity building programmes in Uganda and similar resource-limited settings, to further bridge the gap between doctoral degrees and academic research leadership, building public utility of local scientists to lead, inform and solve local problems within the global context.\nMUII supports a centre of excellence in I&I research and training, with a secretariat based at UVRI. The secretariat comprises the Director, Centre Manager, finance, administration, procurement, monitoring and evaluation, and communication teams which work in close collaboration with UVRI government staff. In addition, MUII has employed scientific staff in areas requiring intensive support and development (initially a senior, expatriate immunologist; subsequently a more junior Ugandan immunologist (recently graduated from an American university); both at first full-time, later part-time. These supported initiation of core training in immunology, and subsequently contributed to development of Makerere’s master’s degree in immunology and clinical microbiology, and the development of a new department of Immunology and Molecular Biology, chaired by a MUII post-doctoral alumnus. Similarly, MUII has supported a lead scientist in bioinformatics, first as a post-doctoral fellow, subsequently as a part-time staff scientist.\nMUII functions through core implementation teams called Impis (from the Zulu word for a band of warriors) which provide support for the fellows’ projects. The Impis include Immunology, Bioinformatics, Fellowships, Mentorship, Monitoring and Evaluation, Internships and Diversity, as well as Community Engagement\n1,\n2. In addition to fellowships, MUII provides opportunities for endeavour awards to allow innovative interventions and visiting scientists awards to allow fellows to invite or visit international experts in specific fields of interest to build research expertise. An executive committee chaired by the Director, with representation from each category of trainees (master’s, PhD and post-doctoral) and from each Impi, manages the implementation of the programme, with oversight from a steering committee. The programme has a Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) consisting of local and international experts in I&I who help to review all programme activities. A SAB member usually chairs fellowship selection committees; and SAB members attend the Annual General Meeting, participating in review of fellows’ progress, programme goals, activities, outputs and outcomes (\nFigure 1).\nWe reviewed programme monitoring and evaluation data, including annual reports (2008–2019), for quantitative data on number of trainees and outputs including publications and research grants. Additionally, in a cross-sectional study, qualitative evaluation was conducted in March and April 2019 by F.Z., a social scientist at the medical research council (with MSc in Gerontology) independent of the MUII programme. A representative sample of 27 trainees (out of 50 then available), and two centre staff was purposefully selected. The purposive representative sample considered representation of five categories of fellows: Masters, PhD, post-doctoral and group-leader fellows, and honorary fellows (not directly funded by MUII, but registered under MUII, participating in fellows’ meetings and training activities, and sometimes receiving small travel or equipment grants). The interviewer introduced herself to all interviewees on email, highlighted the purpose of the interview and made suitable appointments. All participants contacted accepted to participate in face-to-face interviews during working hours. The interview was attended by the interviewer, interviewee and two media staff to audio and video record. Skype interviews were conducted with participants unavailable for face-to-face interaction. Each interview lasted at least 45 minutes.\nIn-depth interviews (IDI) were conducted with the fellows and key informant interviews (KII) with staff, by using a pre-tested topic guide (see\nExtended data) to explore experiences from the MUII programme over the last 10 years. The guide was designed to obtain insights into best practices, challenges, impact, and sustainability of the impact beyond the programme, and included questions on new leadership roles and mentorship experience that fellows have been involved in after participating in the MUII programme.\nQualitative interviews and Skype calls were audio-recorded and later transcribed verbatim. These data were underpinned on content analysis, coded by F.Z., and analysed thematically using a framework that was informed by the study objectives and preliminary findings, according to pre-determined themes of achievements, challenges, lessons learned and recommendations for improvement. The framework was for coding the study data with constant comparison across the team to ensure consistency. The coding of data was managed using NVivo 12.\nThe protocol for the qualitative evaluation was reviewed by the Research Ethics Committee of the Uganda Virus Research Institute, which gave a waiver of written consent and approval to publish these routine program data (REF GC/127/19/03/699). Participants gave verbal consent to participation in the interviews and the use of the material from the interviews, including quotes, in this paper. Permission was sought from participants whose quotations appear in the paper.\nMUII’s principal achievements comprise a) the successes and career progression of trainees, b) growth in Infection and Immunity (I&I) research and training capacity at MUII partner institutions in Uganda, and c) establishment of sustainable international collaborations for young Ugandan scientists.\n\nSuccesses and career progression of trainees. Between January 2008 and December 2019, MUII supported 68 fellowships including 23 master’s fellows, 27 PhD fellows, 15 post-doctoral fellows and three group leaders in I&I research. Of these, 53 were directly funded by MUII, while 15 were honorary fellows (\nTable 1). By December 2019 these fellows, since joining MUII, had published over 300 peer-reviewed publications and received over 20 million Pound Sterling worth of additional funds for research (\nFigure 2). These were all desired outputs of the programme demonstrating the achievement of the goal, “\n...to allow the Fellows to\ndevelop into independently funded research leaders” (EMEL028, M, KII, Centre Staff). Other members of staff commented that seeing alumni ‘take off’ and become independent was a clear mark of success.\nMany MUII alumni have taken on academic leadership roles as Principal Investigators, Heads of Departments, Deans of Schools, supervisors of graduate students, and mentors of other emerging scientists. MUII also supported over 1000 internships at UVRI and exposed over 5000 high school students to scientific research through “Open Days” at UVRI.\n\nGrowth in I&I research at MUII partner institutions in Uganda. Before MUII was launched, there were few facilities for immunology research at Makerere University. Starting with a small immunology laboratory under the Department of Microbiology, MUII contributed to human, technical and physical infrastructural development in I&I capacity. This is evidenced by new Masters’ and doctoral training programmes in Immunology and Clinical Microbiology and in Genomics and Bioinformatics (with increasing numbers of applicants), that have been developed with MUII alumni as heads of departments, supervisors and investigators in multi-disciplinary Infection and Immunity research (\nTable 2).\n“\nSeeing these young Ugandans that have an interest in immunology, seeing that interest develop, bud and flower into a full-blown passion for immunology and seeing them start thinking about their research in immunological terms and to start to win grants in immunology! That for me is success” (EMEL028, M, KII, Centre Staff)\n\nSustainable training and research collaborations. Through MUII, fellows created and consolidated collaborations and networks with over 40 institutions globally. Illustrative examples are listed in\nTable 3. These institutions have supported training in fields such as genetics, antimicrobial resistance, systems biology, bioinformatics, metagenomics, molecular and cell biology, vaccine development, and biomarker research (\nTable 3): fields in which world class expertise was not available in Uganda. In addition, these collaborations have helped to position fellows to achieve recognition internationally:\n“\n…by linking me to Professors in the United Kingdom, it has really expanded my horizon because with them we have been able to compete at a bigger stage…Right now my light is shining because of this bigger stage that the collaboration has enabled me to get into. So it has really been very instrumental.” (EMEL015, M, IDI, Group Leader).\nHowever, interviewees reported several important challenges encountered.\n\nProcurement. Delay in procurement of biological research supplies was reported as a critical challenge. Most government procurement systems did not have provision for direct orders from international suppliers of reagents specifically used in published immunology protocols, without the bureaucracy of local agents. This was a bottleneck to timely implementation of research and many fellows relied on international laboratory placements to complete their work. One fellow commented: “\nI spent most of my time in the lab overseas to avoid delays because that is where I could get my supplies continuously delivered almost immediately from the manufacturing company.” (EMEL004, F, IDI, Group Leader). Others mentioned the need to place orders directly with manufacturers to avoid local agents and procurement delays.\nNevertheless, the procurement teams at UVRI and Makerere worked together to understand the issues affecting the researchers and did their best within the allowable clauses and limitations in policies for procurement of research reagents and equipment.\n\nTime management. A common challenge for fellows was to meet deadlines, and many mentioned that they had to balance research with their clinical and teaching responsibilities: “\nOne still has to perform their roles as a clinician, teacher, researcher, Head of Department, wife, mother, etc.” (EMEL001, F, IDI, post-doc). Time pressure increased as fellows advanced in their research career.\n\nLimited pool of clinical immunology and bioinformatics experts. Some fields had very limited local capacity for application of immunology and bioinformatics tools to address challenging threats: for example, the field of maternal health for the challenge of pre-eclampsia. MUII responded to this challenge through the support of international collaborators (\nTable 3). Some of these collaborative efforts have resulted in lasting collaborations between fellows and supervisors, for example:\n“\nThe collaboration with Cambridge started with a PhD student and her mentor but now lots of other people involved in the health arena from Cambridge are working with her department. That is the ideal way we would like to see collaborations grow.” (EMEL029, F, KII, Centre Staff).\n\nUncertain sustainability of active research programmes beyond MUII. Maintaining active research beyond their MUII funding was a challenge for fellows, with the prospect of attracting funding appearing quite daunting: “\nI need real significant funding which can maintain a group or team of six people for three years. I also need support in terms of someone commenting on the proposal or application and being connected to people of similar interests.” (EMEL009, M, IDI, post-doc).\nHowever, many fellows appreciated that this challenge was to be expected and competitive resource mobilisation is part of being a research scientist. To address this challenge, MUII organised skills-building meetings for fellows including grant writing and peer-review to increase the competitiveness of applications. In addition, MUII supports a mentorship programme where fellows can be linked to experts in their field.\nInterviewees shared key lessons learned in capacity building for research in resource-limited settings.\n\nProgramme administration and organisation. Good operational management was key to success of the training and research programme (\nFigure 1 and\nTable 2). The distribution of roles to improve efficiency and the monitoring and evaluation functions helped the fellows to adhere to research regulations and programme timelines for master’s and doctoral students. Many of the fellows were grateful for the support they had received to enable them to graduate.\n“\nMUII has had 100% success of [Masters] graduation on time. The programme pays attention to the Fellows. I think it has been excellent in terms of mentorship of the Fellows...” (EMEL005, M, IDI, master’s).\n\nMulti-disciplinary collaboration within Uganda between leading academic and research institutions. MUII showed that it was feasible to develop and sustain collaborations between UVRI and the Makerere Colleges of Health Sciences; Veterinary Medicine, Animal Resources and Biosecurity; Natural Sciences; and Computing and Information Sciences (\nTable 3). This collaborative infrastructure was appreciated by fellows as a strength:\n“\n…I applied [for the Group Leader Position] because I thought it would really give this cross multi disciplinarity, not just being at Makerere University, but also interacting with other research institutions in Uganda. UVRI is a premiere research institution in this country. So I thought it would be an opportunity for me to liaise with other scientists…” (EMEL015, M, IDI, Group Leader).\n\nProcurement of research reagents and equipment. Public academic and research institutions need to be supported to foster active framework agreements with international manufacturers of biological research reagents to minimise time delays created by looking for local agents who do not routinely import items that are specific to biological laboratory experiments and innovations.\n\nMentorship. Supporting young researchers to progress through MSc, PhD and post-doc programmes and subsequently to develop as group leaders to mentor other upcoming scientists and maintain the pipeline has been greatly valued.\n“\nDuring the ten-year period, there were opportunities for MUII graduates at any level to apply (competing with other non-MUII applicants) for available MUII opportunities at the next level of career development. ‘I was privileged to have a very good supervisor and mentor who gave me time, gave my applications time and gave my research ideas time. So that I attribute to mentorship.” (EMEL001, F, IDI, post-doc).\n\nSustainability of I&I research. Most fellows and graduates of the MUII programme have been able to win career development and research grants to sustain their research groups. Fellows, however, mentioned their need for more technical support to respond to funding opportunities as well as additional training in community engagement, leadership, and data management.\n“\nI think we’ve been a pretty good example across the whole DELTAS [funding programme] network in getting out early PhD Fellows and they are in a position of getting their own research grants, they are heads of departments, deans of faculties and they are running their own profile research. I think that is where the sustainability comes in.” (EMEL028, M, KII, Centre Staff).\nSimilarly, the MUII alumni that have grown professionally to take academic and research leadership positions are nurturing a culture that fosters high quality research in I&I research and are already mentoring other upcoming scientists.\n“\nWe have had a PhD funded fellow who is now working as Dean at the Vet School. We have a Group Leader who is the Dean of the Medical School. We have another Group Leader who is the head of the Obs and Gyn Department. So I think through them and other MUII alumni in other influential areas at Makerere University would make MUII and other research collaborations more sustainable.” (EMEL029, F, KII, Centre Staff).\n“\n…I have six PhD students that I supervise and mentor but in addition to that I mentor many other gynaecologists, even students outside my department…I mentor over 20 [students] because every time people come to consult me on different things.” (EMEL018, F, IDI, Group Leader).\nThe MUII capacity-building programme in I&I has demonstrated ten years of high quality training in emerging tools of immunology and bioinformatics to answer locally generated questions to address gaps in knowledge and practice in the dominating infections of HIV, tuberculosis, malaria and its complications, helminths and emerging viruses, as well as the rising burden of non-communicable diseases including asthma, diabetes, hypertension and pre-eclampsia\n6–\n32. Through the spectrum of fellowships provided, from the most junior of undergraduate interns to master’s, doctoral, post-doctoral and group-leader awards, MUII has provided mentored research training opportunities to foster growth of academic research careers. With the engagement of scientific and non-scientific community, MUII scientists disseminated their science, its relevance in the local context and exposed it to over 5000 high school students (tomorrow’s scientists). The impact has been demonstrated by the programme monitoring and evaluation indicators that include, among others, peer-reviewed publications, additional funding for research and capacity building obtained by trainees, emergence of multi-disciplinary research groups, increasing applicants to the new MUII-supported masters’ and doctoral programmes in immunology and bioinformatics, and number of active local and international collaborations.\nUnlike capacity-building initiatives that have focused on increasing the number of medical graduates for health care\n3,\n4 and doctoral training in various fields\n5,\n33, MUII has focused on developing experts in I&I - a major gap that slackens local biomedical responses to emerging infections in Africa. In addition, MUII has embraced the challenge of technology transfer of new immunology and bioinformatics techniques with the aim that MUII trainees will be empowered to lead novel initiatives like developing vaccine or therapeutic targets for emerging diseases. In a modest way, MUII tried to mimic what developing an academic research career would entail in high-income settings, where a developing research group requires fellowship schemes to kick-start scientists, PhD students and post-docs to be part of novel ideas and publications, technicians to support high-throughput equipment, dry laboratory scientists for genomic analyses and mathematical modelling\n2. We recommend monitoring of equipment booking schedules to use wet laboratory equipment for immunology and molecular biology assays, abstracts presented at relevant local and international meetings, meetings held by our scientists with community, policymakers and other relevant stakeholders to demonstrate productivity and utility of the scientists. These are all critical for the next level of development of science in Africa. Improved management strategies are needed to tackle the epidemiological change facing Africa due to urbanisation and changes in lifestyle like the emerging burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in Africa\n2. Appropriate diagnostics, treatment and vaccines are needed in the face of unprecedented emerging pandemics, such as the current COVID-19 crisis. Locally generated evidence is critical to local management of such global pandemics; with examples of fast-tracked clinical trial data emerging from China and USA\n34,\n35 and the reliance of countries on their leading scientists\n36 to inform national and global interventions. There is need for clinical trials within the local and cultural context of communities and health system. For example, it is not obvious that host responses to hydroxychloroquine and <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightorange; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">azithromycin<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">chemical</span>\n</mark> as COVID-19 <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightpink; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">trial<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">trials</span>\n</mark>  <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightgreen; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">therapies<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">usages</span>\n</mark> in America <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightblue; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">would<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">ideas</span>\n</mark> be similar to those in sub-Saharan Africa where both drugs have been used commonly for endemic malaria and atypical pneumonias, or that vaccines developed in high-income settings will be equally effective in Africa.\nThe MUII experience is unprecedented because of the previous absence of local advanced training programmes (MSc and doctoral level) in immunology and bioinformatics to advance locally trained scientists in I&I research. Therefore, the lessons learned over the decade of implementation of the programme, presented here, are noteworthy to inform ongoing and future capacity building programmes on the African continent.\nMUII had a dedicated secretariat to support programme communications, tracking, and evaluation. In addition, MUII supported two immunologists to be part of the new department of Immunology and Molecular Biology that is chaired by a former MUII post-doc. Similar input was previously illustrated by an ongoing capacity building programme for cancer research that protected support staff time of approximately 0.25 to 0.5 full-time equivalents contributed to the success of the programme\n37. The MUII secretariat also organised regular meetings which made it easy for people to be accountable not only for their time but also to their set goals. MUII also offered training in research methods, data analysis, use of data analysis software packages, grant writing, report writing, presentation skills, among others. During the regular programme capacity building meetings, fellows would critique each other’s work, which greatly improved the quality of proposals and presentations. Fellows also had opportunities to participate in different workshops and conferences. MUII fellows were prepared to become better mentors, and many of them acquired peer mentees, as previously noted that peer mentorship greatly supported in-country capacity building initiatives\n37. At the regular progress meetings fellows discussed bottlenecks in their progress such as delayed procurement of specific reagents and equipment that required direct importation from manufacturers abroad. Both MUII institutions (UVRI and Makerere) still need support to develop and implement efficient policies that reduce the turn-around time for research reagents and equipment orders, many of which are expensive sole supplier items because of previously optimised protocols and equipment\n38.\nMUII programme increased trainees’ networking opportunities through the large pool of multi-disciplinary scientists and through several collaborations established as well as the visiting scientist awards where fellows also had opportunities to invite expert scientists to support training and research locally. For example, as part of a visiting award, the translational immunology group led by Damalie Nakanjako (Physician) invited an expert in multicolour flowcytometry (Glenda Canderan from the Department of Pathology at Case Western Reserve University, USA) to support the team through their large flowcytometry panels using the 20-color LSRII flowcytometer at UVRI campus. Subsequently the team published important results that demonstrated persistent innate immune dysfunction (NK cells, monocytes and Innate lymphoid cells) despite long-term antiretroviral therapy\n23–\n25. Similarly, maternal health group, led by Annettee Nakimuli (Obstetrician and Gynaecology), through Ashley Moffet and Corina Alberg provided several opportunities for Uganda’s junior scientists to network and collaborate with experts in the field of KIR genes and their role in pre-eclampsia which is the leading cause of poor maternal and fetal outcomes in Uganda\n26,\n39. Subsequently two more PhD students are being trained in this field on the programme. In addition, Makerere University graduate trainees (MSc and doctoral) and staff in Immunology and Bioinformatics attend regular remote seminars provided by Cambridge University using the WebEx (Cisco WebEx, Milpitas, CA).\nEach of MUII’s PhD and post-doctoral Fellows had the opportunity to travel as they had to have an international collaborator as well as local collaborators. That approach multiplied the collaborations by the number of fellows. In a survey of a cancer research capacity building programme, training doctoral students and fellows, only 3/38 (7%) had adequate opportunities to network with other researchers\n37. Our involvement of world-class experts in the fields of interest helped to mitigate the previously noted challenge of limited experts to mentor emerging scientists in Uganda\n40,\n41. Collaborators/co-supervisors and co-mentors were key elements in the programme because of the limited critical mass of mid-and-advanced career scientists in the country. In the past, many of Uganda’s experts were scattered globally due to cultural, geopolitical and socio-economic drivers of brain drain\n37,\n38,\n41. Fellows highlighted that MUII provided them a lot of exposure that opened several opportunities to pursue careers in research. The multi-disciplinary nature of the collaborations established by MUII has birthed long-term bonds with the participating institutions of LSHTM, Cambridge University and the Sanger Institute, among others; which will continue to be utilised by students and faculty beyond the MUII funding.\nMUII has demonstrated a decade of mentored academic productivity in I&I research. Its sustainability is evidenced by the continuing mentorship, research groups, training programmes, resource mobilisation and global collaborations that have emerged to contribute to solutions to Africa’s health care problems. More skills and commitment remain necessary for trainees in developing countries to compete favourably for international research funding to build and sustain a critical mass of I&I scientists, to respond to current and emerging health problems.\nInterview transcripts contain information that could be used to identify participants.

Concomitantly, the patients received various other drugs. In 1346−3366 days from the transplantion, the patients developed COVID-19. At hospitalisation, the presenting symptoms were cough, chills, nasal congestion and myalgias (1 patient), fever, chills, myalgias, cough and headache (1 patient) and fever, myalgias, headache and emesis (1 patient). In two of the three patients, chest X-ray showed relative radiation level and nodular opacities. CT findings showed patch opacity/multifocal in two of the three patients. Laboratory test results were as follows: WBC initial 3.78−9.1 K/µL, WBC nadir 2.38−4.02 K/µL, lymphocyte count 0.81−1.22 [unit not stated], ferritin 101−1664 ng/mL, CRP 3.44−17.97 mg/dL, initial creatinine 1.2−1.93 mg/dL and peak creatinine 1.2−1.9 mg/dL.

Eight days afterwards, she was initiated empirically on hydroxychloroquine 200mg two times a day [route not stated] because her COVID-19 results were not yet available. Following 4 days of treatment, she woke up with rash on the abdomen and neck, which progressed to her face and extremities.\nThe woman was advised to stop hydroxychloroquine, and received tapering dose of methylprednisolone, which did not ameliorate her rash. She was found to be negative for COVID-19. The rash progressed, and pruritus was unrelenting. Twelve days following the initiation of hydroxychloroquine, she presented at an outside hospital, where she was administered IV methylprednisolone. Her rash continued to spread, and she developed facial swelling. Thus, she presented to the Emergency Room for evaluation (current presentation). Her skin exam was significant for facial oedema, erythematous macules and edematous papules coalescing into plaques on the face, thighs, trunk and bilateral arms. Scattered, non-follicular pustules were observed on the lateral neck and abdomen. The oral mucosa was hyperemic without erosions or ulcerations. Her laboratory tests were significant for hepatic and renal function within normal limits, negative COVID-19 testing and an increased white blood cell count with neutrophilia and no eosinophilia. She was admitted and treated conservatively with triamcinolone, but experienced additional pustule formation and remarkable pruritus, requiring one administration of IV methylprednisolone. The following morning, she denied mucosal pain, and her skin was less erythematous. The laboratory studies remained stable. For the further treatment of her active but improving rash, she was switched to prednisone taper. A skin biopsy, collected before the treatment, revealed a subcorneal pustule with neutrophils and eosinophils congruous with a diagnosis of acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis. After 38 days, her rash resolved with the prednisone taper.</br></br>UNKNOWN URL AND TITLE</br></br>\nAuthor Information\nAn event is serious (based on the ICH definition) when the patient outcome is:* death* life-threatening* hospitalisation* disability* congenital anomaly* other medically important event\n\nIn a series of 3 cases, a 75-year-old man was described, who exhibited lack of efficacy during treatment with norepinephrine, phenylephrine and vasopressin for hypotension.\nThe man, who had type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease and hyperlipidaemia, was referred to the hospital with 1 week of fatigue, cough and fevers.

On day 6 of admission, he was intubated due to persisting hypoxaemia. His D-dimer levels were found to be consistently >50000 ng/mL for 4 days after intubation, and his fibrinogen levels were between 375 and 541 mg/dL. On day 8 of hospitalisation, his partial pressure of oxygen/FiO2 (P/F) ratio ranged between 140 and 240. A diagnosis of COVID-19 associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure was considered. He became anuric. Therefore, he was started on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT); that combined with persistently increased D-dimer. Thus, it was decided to initiate off-label treatment with a tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) for the COVID-19 associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) considering a possibility of thromboembolism. Therefore, IV infusion of alteplase (a tPA therapy) was initiated at 25mg over 2 hours of infusion, followed by a 25mg infusion over the subsequent 22 hours. He tolerated tPA therapy with no bleeding or any other apparent complications. His P/F ratio also found to be improved. After completion of tPA therapy, he was initiated on heparin with a partial thromboplastin time goal of 60 to 80. An hour into the heparin infusion, the P/F ratio worsened. There was a concern for pulmonary oedema and fluid overload given he was 1L positive on his fluid balance for the previous 24 hours and remained anuric on CRRT; however, efforts to remove volume via CRRT were complicated by the development of hypotension and rapid atrial fibrillation. These complications made it difficult to attain a negative fluid balance. His vasopressor requirements increased from 1 to 3; and started receiving vasopressin, norepinephrine and phenylephrine [dosages and routes not stated]. At 48 hours after-tPA, his P/F was similar to his pre-tPA status. His D-dimer also decreased and fibrinogen levels remained similar. However, by day 11 of hospitalisation, he continued to descend into multiple organ failure with refractory hypotension despite treatment with vasopressor therapy. A superimposed bacterial infection and arrhythmia were also noted [aetiology not stated]. He died eventually [immediate cause of death not stated].</br></br>UNKNOWN URL AND TITLE</br></br>\nAuthor Information\nAn event is serious (based on the ICH definition) when the patient outcome is:* death* life-threatening* hospitalisation* disability* congenital anomaly* other medically important event\n\nA 52-year-old man developed drug-induced liver injury during treatment with tocilizumab for cytokine release syndrome.\nThe man was returned from Serbia to Montenegro on 10 March 2020.

As per Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method/Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS/RUCAM) method and European Association for the Study of the Liver guidelines, the causal relationship between drug-induced liver injury and tocilizumab was assessed as probably related. In view of his poor general condition, liver biopsy was not performed.\nSeveral days after tocilizumab administration, the man's clinical condition improved with a remarkable decrease in CRP, IL-6 and D-dimer levels. Afterwards, his condition became complicated due to subcutaneous emphysema and bilateral pneumothorax [aetiologies not stated]. Therefore, a drain thoracostomy was performed.

Screening of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) level was done as a part of the protocol during initiation of hydroxychloroquine treatment, and he was found to be G6PD deficient. Thus, he had simultaneous haemoglobin D thalassemia and G6PD deficiency. Thus, hydroxychloroquine was discontinued after 3 doses, to avoid major haemolytic crisis. Considering the progression of COVID-19 associated pneumonia, treatment of ceftriaxone was escalated to piperacillin/tazobactam. Before admission, his serum aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were normal. From day 7 to 14, there was a transient rise in liver transaminases. His WBC and RBC count decreased. His Hb level also decreased from 12.2 to 9.1 gm/dL over the next 10 days. Haemolysis workup showed elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Peripheral smear revealed moderate hypochromic microcytic anaemia with anisocytosis, schistocytes, spherocytes, fragmented RBCs, few teardrop cells and few ovalocytes. Reticulocyte count was 0.7%, 0.8% and 0.7% on admission, on day 10 and on day 18, respectively. There was no evidence of haemoglobinuria or haematuria.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus also encodes other poly-proteins, nucleoproteins and membranous proteins, in other words RNA polymerase, helicase and various proteases [13,14].\nThe initial infection requires viral entry into the host cell. The S-glycoprotein mediates binding of the virus to the human cell surface receptors, followed by fusion of the virus and host cell membranes to assist viral entrance (Figure 3) [15,16]. The S-glycoprotein is a structural protein that accounts for the crown-like shape of the CoVs. The 1200 AA length S-protein (approx. 180 kDa) is a member of class-I viral fusion proteins [17,18]. It is expressed on the surface of the virus as a trimetric protein and also determines the host tropism and pathogenesis [19–21]. The S-glycoprotein can be cleaved by host proteases to an N-terminal S1-ectodomain and C-terminal S2-membrane-anchored protein (Figure 2B) [22]. In several CoVs, the higher amplification of S-protein at the cell membrane can also facilitate membrane fusion of infected cells with adjacent uninfected cells, and this leads to the formation of giant or multinucleated cells (syncytia) and further spread of the virus between cells [23–25]. The CoVs S1-protein includes a receptor-binding domain (RBD), which binds to the host cell via receptors that include the ACE2 receptor [26]. SARS-CoV uses the ACE2 receptor for entry [26] and uses the serine protease, cathepsins and TMPRSS2, for S-protein priming [24,27]. Of 14 AA residues in the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV, eight residues are highly conserved in SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that the ACE2 receptor is also used for cell entry by this virus [28]. Labeling studies have confirmed this [4,29]. The S-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 has a 3D structure within the RBD domain that conserve the van der Waals interactions [4]. The 394 glutamine residue of the SARS-CoV-2's RBD domain is ligated via the important lysine 31 residue of the human receptor, ACE2 [28].\nAn E-protein is involved in the assembly and release of virus-like particles [30–32]. M-protein provides the shape of the viral envelope and binding to nucleocapsid [33], whereas, the N-protein binds to the CoV RNA genome, building the nucleocapsid to support replication–transcription complex [34]. Interaction between M and N-proteins stabilize the nucleocapsid and the internal core of virus, and, eventually, enhance the assembly of the virion particles [23,35,36]. M-, E- and S-proteins then enter into the endoplasmic reticulum–Golgi intermediate compartment complex and constitute the viral envelope [36]. Accessory proteins appear to promote the adaptation of CoVs to human host cells [37].\nGenomic analysis of ten genome of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from nine patients demonstrated 99.98% nucleotide identity [38]. Another report found that 99.8–99.9% sequence similarity in sample of five infected patients [39]. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 shares 50 and 80.0% nucleotide identity to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, respectively [8,13,38].\nThe SARS-CoV-2 constitutes a clade among the sub-genus sarbecovirus [40]. Bioinformatics analysis of the viral genome from one COVID-19 patient shared 89 and 82% sequence similarity with bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21 and human SARS-CoV, respectively [41]. However, the external subunit of Spike RBD of SARS-CoV-2 has only 40% amino acid (AA) identity with other SARS-associated CoVs [41]. The S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 is longer (1282 AA) than for other viruses such as SARS-CoV (1255 AA) and Bat SARS-like CoVs (1246 AA). The S-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 has been found to have three short insertions at the N-terminal end, with four variations in the receptor binding site within the RBD compared with SARS-CoV [42]. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 ORF3b codifies a new short protein. Moreover, its novel ORF8 sequence possibly encode a secreted protein with an α-helical structure with a β-sheet(s) consisting of six strands [41]. The high levels of genetic identity (96.3%) between the SARS-CoV-2 and Bat-CoV RaTG13 does not indicate the precise variant that may have led to the outbreak in humans, although it has been suggested that the likelihood that the novel CoV has derived from bats is very probable [43]. SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 differ with respect to the number of major genomic properties, in which SARS-CoV-2 harbors a polybasic (furin) cleavage site insertion at the connection of the two subunits of the S-protein, S1 and S2 [44].\nThe N-protein is hidden within phospholipid bilayers and coated via two distinctive forms of S-proteins including the spike glycoprotein trimmer which is present in all CoVs, as well as the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) solely found in certain CoVs. For instance, SARS-CoV-2 does not appear to have the HE gene. The M and E proteins are found inside the S-glycoproteins within the viral envelope [45]. The S, E, M, N and ORF3a genes of SARS-CoV-2 are predicted to be 3822, 228, 669, 1260 and 828 nucleotides in length, respectively. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 has been predicted to contain an ORF8 gene, of 366 nucleotide size, situated between the M and N corresponding ORF genes [45].\nThe SARS-CoV sequence reveals serine substituting for glycine in the residue at position 543 of the nsp3 protein in Bat SARS-like and SARS-CoV. This AA substitution could promote local stiffness of the polypeptide chain for steric impact and potency of the serine side-chain to constitute H-bonds. Beside, serine is a nucleophile that can establish structural environments, like those at active sites of enzyme. Mutations in the nsp3 protein were reported to affect the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in infected cells [46,47]. It has been reported that the single N501T variant in SARS-CoV-2's S-protein may enhance binding affinity for the ACE2 cellular receptor [28]. Furthermore, a single N439R mutation in SARS-CoV-2 RBD promotes its ACE2-receptor binding and, thus potentially enhances human-to-human transmission [48,49]. By studying the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding to the human ACE2 receptor has shown that the ACE2 receptor-binding ridge in SARS-CoV-2 RBD results in a more compact conformation, leading structural alterations at the RBD/ACE2 interface versus the SARS-CoV [48]. Overall, SARS-CoV-2 binding affinity for ACE2 is 10–20-times greater than for other SARS-associated CoVs [50].\nA missense mutation at the 614 position of S protein (aspartate to glycine, D614G mutation), in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, which has emerged as a predominant clade in Europe (66% sequences) and is spreading worldwide (44% sequences). The D614G mutation promotes viral infectivity and transduction of multiple human cell types and mitigates neutralization sensitivity to individual convalescent sera [51–54].\nLipids play important roles at different stages in the CoVs life cycle. CoVs recruit intracellular membranes of the host cells to produce new compartments, or double membrane vesicles, which are used for the replication of the virion particle genome [55]. Recently, an important lipid processing enzyme, known as cPLA2 α has been reported to be related to the formation of double membrane vesicle and CoV’s amplification [56]. It has been demonstrated that the enzyme, phospholipase A2 group IID, is involved in anti-inflammation or proresolving lipid mediator regulation which may lead to worse outcomes in a SARS-CoV infection animal model by modulating the immune response [57].\nIt has been shown that there is a distinct insert that includes basic AAs in the S1/S2 priming loop of SARS-CoV-2, which is not found in SARS-CoV or any SARS-associated CoVs. It may substantially alter the entry pathway of SARS-CoV-2 compared with other viruses of the β-CoVs lineage B [58]. In a recent report it was shown that SARS-CoV-2's S-protein entry into 293/human ACE2 receptor cells is primarily mediated via endocytosis, and that PIKfyve, a TPC2 and cathepsin L are crucial for virus entry. PIKfyve is the key enzyme in the early endosome involved in the synthesis of PI(3,5)P2 and its main downstream effector, TPC2. The S protein of SARS-CoV-2 could also stimulate syncytia in 293/human ACE2 cells independently of exogenous protease [59].\nIn a study of 452 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, it was found that severely affected cases had lower numbers of blood lymphocytes, percentages of monocytes, basophils and eosinophils as well as increased leukocytes numbers and neutrophil-lymphocyte-ratio. In most patients with unfavorable progression of COVID-19, elevated concentrations of infection-associated markers and inflammatory cytokines was observed. The frequency of T cells was significantly lower, and less effective in severely affected subjects. Both T helper (Th) cells and suppressor T cell numbers in patients with COVID-19 were below the reference range. The percentage of naive helper T cells was increased, and memory helper T cells and regulatory T cells reduced in severe conditions [60]. Furthermore, simultaneous to the infection with SARS-CoV-2, CD4+ T lymphocytes are quickly over-activated to switch to the pathogenic Th1 cells producing GM-CSF. The cytokines environment activates inflammatory CD14+CD16+ monocytes, leading to over-expression of IL-6 and enhances the inflammatory response. Regarding the increased infiltrations of inflammatory cells that have been found in lungs of severe SARS-CoV-2 infected patients [61,62], these population of abnormal and noneffective pathogenic Th1 cells and inflammatory granulocytes may go to the pulmonary circulation and by immune stimulation, lead to functional impairment of the lungs and eventually death [63].\nInflammasomes are very large intracellular poly-protein signaling complexes which are constitute in the cytosol as an inflammatory immune reaction to endogenous danger stimuli [64]. NLRP3 responds to wide spectra of pathogens and endogenous signals, and is involved in the molecular pathway of various auto-inflammatory disorders [65]. It has been reported that the SARS-CoV can induce the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages through ORF8b. Whereas SARS-CoV infects macrophages or monocytes, sufficient ORF8b may be present to impact on the autophagy-lysosome pathway, and NLRP3 inflammasomes. SARS-CoV replicates efficiently in lung epithelial cells. These cells also amplify NLRP3 and support assembly of NLRP3 inflammasomes. In SARS-CoV patients, the full effect of the ORF-8b on these inflammatory cascades was observed in the lung epithelium. Interestingly, ORF8b may be involved in the ‘cytokine storm’ or ‘cytokine cascade’ and inflammasome induction which happens within intensive SARS-CoV infection [66].\nSARS-CoV-2 infection stimulates the immune response in two stages. In the early stages, a particular adaptive immune response is necessary to eradicate the virus and to impede progress to a more severe condition. The protective immune response at this phase requires that the host should have excellent general health and a suitable genetic context which provides antiviral immunity [67]. Although, when the immune response protection is disabling, virus will disseminate and great damage to the affected tissues occurs, particularly in organs with a high levels of ACE2 receptor expression. The injured cells activate innate inflammation within the lungs which is mainly mediated through pro-inflammatory macrophages/monocytes. Lung inflammation is the major reason for the fatal respiratory disease at the severe stage of COVID-19 [68].\nIn viral infections, host antiviral microRNAs participate in the regulation of immune response to virus and are capable of targeting viral genes and interfere with replication, mRNA expression and protein translation of virion particle gene. Sardar et al. predicted the antiviral host-microRNAs specifically for COVID-19. They reported a list of six microRNAs related to COVID-19 including hsa-let-7a, hsa-miR101, hsa-miR126, hsa-miR23b, hsa-miR378 and hsa-miR98 which has been previously reported to be related to other viral infections, such as HIV [69].\nVirion particles spread from the respiratory mucosa, by binding to the ACE2 receptors on ciliated bronchial epithelial cells, and after that may engage with other cells [70]. In one report from Wuhan, the average incubation period of 425 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients was 5.2 days, but it this differed between individuals [71,72]. Until now, most patients with COVID-19 have initially presented with mild manifestations in other words dry cough, sore throat and fever which spontaneously resolve. Although, some patients have developed other more severe disease such as organ failure, septic shock, pulmonary edema, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue and acute respiratory distress syndrome [73]. In contrast to SARS-CoV, patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, development of upper respiratory tract signs and manifestations are less common, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may target cells in the lower airway [74]. Among cases with severe dyspnea, more than 50% have required intensive care. Some COVID-19 cases do not present with fever or radiologic abnormalities on admission, which makes initial diagnosis difficult [75].\nThe main characteristics of COVID-19 on preliminary CT examination including bilateral multi-lobar ground-glass opacities with a peripheral/posterior distribution and patchy consolidation, primarily in the lower lobes and fewer inside the right middle lobe [76]. The main reported laboratory test abnormalities in cases with severe COVID-19 infection include: increased levels of liver enzymes (LDH, ALT and AST), total bilirubin, creatinine, cardiac troponin, D-dimer, prothrombin time, procalcitonin and CRP [77].\nThe histology of liver specimens of SARS-CoV infected patients have revealed a remarkable liver injury with an increase in mitotic cells, along with eosinophilic bodies as well as balloon-like hepatocytes [78]. Cardiac involvement is another prominent manifestation of COVID-19 and is closely related to a poor outcome [79]. In a recent systematic review, the incidence rate of diarrhea varied from 2 to 50% in COVID-19 patients. It may develop earlier, or following the respiratory symptoms. Findings of several studies showed that viral RNA shedding is detect for a longer time period compared with nasopharyngeal swabs [50].\nIn an investigation on 1099 COVID-19 patients, of whom 23.7% had severe disease with comorbidities of hypertension, 16.2% diabetes mellitus, 5.8% coronary heart diseases and 2.3% cerebrovascular disease [80]. Another study, of 140 patients with COVID-19, found that 30% and 12% had history of hypertension and diabetes, respectively [81]. Analysis of 487 COVID-19 cases, showed that older age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.06; 95% CI: 1.03–1.1), male gender (OR 3.7; 95% CI: 1.7–7.7) and hypertension as a comorbidity (OR 2.7; 95% CI: 1.3–5.6) are related with more severe disease on admission [82]. Moreover, patients with cancer were more vulnerable to severe events from COVID-19 such as admission to the intensive care unit needing invasive ventilation, or death [83].\nIt has been reported that the highest viral load in throat swabs occurs at the time of development of symptoms. However, viral shedding was reported to occur before the onset of symptoms, and a major proportion of transmissibility happened before first symptoms in the index case [84]. Furthermore, severe COVID-19 cases tend to have an increased viral load and a long virus-shedding time [85].\nAt present, the diagnosis of COVID-19 is largely based on guideline agreement that includes laboratory tests and chest CT imaging technique [75,86]. PCR testing of asymptomatic or mild symptomatic contacts can be used in the evaluation of peoples who have been in contact with a COVID-19 case [87], and the WHO has not accepted the results of a chest CT without RT-PCR conformation in the diagnosis of COVID-19 [88].\nChest CT is a routine imaging tool for the diagnosis of pneumonia, which is relatively easy and rapid to perform. Chest CT shows typical radiographic characteristics in almost all COVID-19 cases, such as peripheral/posterior distribution and patchy consolidation, and/or interstitial alterations with a peripheral distribution, so may provide benefit for diagnosis of COVID-19 [89].\nRespiratory tract samples were collected for the diagnosis and screening of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia; in the 5–6 days of the initiation of symptoms, patients with COVID-19 have increased viral loads in their upper and lower respiratory tracts [90,91]. For suspected cases, real-time fluorescence (RT-PCR) was performed to detect the positive nucleic acid of SARS-CoV-2 in sputum, throat swabs and secretions of the lower respiratory tract specimens [92]. A nasopharyngeal and/or an oropharyngeal swab are frequently recommended for screening or diagnosis of early infection [10,93]. A single nasopharyngeal swab has become the preferable swab as it is well-tolerated by the patient and safer for the operator.\nSerological testing detects presence of IgG, IgM or both. A positive elucidation has been defined as a positive lgM, or convalescent sera with a higher lgG titer >four-times in comparison with the acute phase. SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM are detected in whole blood, plasma, serum or specimens. Antibodies increase late in the course of illness; the mean duration of SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibody detection was reported to be 5 days, whereas IgG detection about 2 week following the appearance of symptoms [94]. In contrast to respiratory samples which may disturb from false-negative results because of the sampling factors, the presence of antibodies in blood uniformly is detectable. Specimens are easier to gather versus respiratory samples, such as fewer risks to the operator. The serological assay is very easy, rapid, availability of ELISA platforms, requires no instrumentation and can provide results in just 15 min [95].\nResults from several in vitro and clinical studies demonstrated that chloroquine phosphate, an old agent for the treatment of malaria, had significant efficacy and acceptable safety for treatment of COVID-19 [98,99]. Findings of an open-label nonrandomized clinical trial among 22 infected patients indicated that hydroxychloroquine <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightgreen; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">treatment<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">usages</span>\n</mark> significantly <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightgreen; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">reduced<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">usages</span>\n</mark> viral load in COVID-19 cases and its effectiveness is promoted by <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightorange; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">azithromycin<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">chemical</span>\n</mark> [99]. In a systematic review including six published articles highlighting the potency of chloroquine in attenuation the replication of SARS-CoV-2-associated virus [100]. But several other studies demonstrated no evidence of a strong antiviral function, or clinical benefit of the hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 [101,102].\nThe combination of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV–R) is extensively used for treating HIV-infected patients. LPV–R has been suggested for treatment of COVID-19. A total of 199 COVID-19 patients were randomly assigned to receive LPV–R (n = 99) or standard-care (n = 100). Treatment with LPV–R was not different from standard care regarding the time to clinical improvement, mortality rate at 28 days, as well as detection of viral RNA at different time points [103].\nArbidol as a wide-spectrum antiviral compound that can inhibit viral fusion of influenza. In one study, 50 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV2 were randomly divided into two arms: 34 cases received LPV–R (400 mg/100 mg, two per day) and 16 patients were administrated arbidol (0.2 g a; three per day). No difference was observed concerning fever duration between the two arms. 2 weeks after the intervention, no viral load was found in cases received arbidol, while the viral load was detectable in 44.1% of LPV–R group patients. Moreover, no adverse side effects were reported in either arm [104].\nNelfinavir (NFV) is a potent HIV-1 protease inhibitor that received US FDA approval in 1997 for treatment of HIV infection. The antiviral activity of NFV against SARS-CoV-2 was reported in Vero E6 cells [105]. By using an integrative computational drug-discovery method, NFV was introduced as a potential inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 main protease [106].\nThe main protease of CoVs (Mpro) is an important protein necessary for the proteolytic maturation of the virion particle [107]. Therefore, targeting Mpro is considered to havepotential as a treatment for COVID-19 through suppression of the polypeptide cleavage virus [108–110]. Concerning the results of molecular docking, natural polyphenols such as hesperidin, rutin, diosmin, apiin and diacetyl-curcumin have been reported to have acceptable efficacy to target SARS-CoV-2 Mpro than NFV [111].\nCytokine-directed antagonists, in other words adalimumab (TNF-α) and CMAB806 (IL-6) against SARS-CoV-2 have been evaluated in clinical trials. The variety of cytokines such as type-I IFN-I contribute to the ‘cytokine storm’ and pathology of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, targeting the upstream origin of cytokine generation could be a promising therapeutic approach [112].\nUtilizing an in silico model, it has been shown that antipolymerase agents including sofosbuvir, IDX-184, ribavirin (RBV) and remidisvir (GS-5734; RDV) can target RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2 [113]. The first severe-infected patient with SARS-CoV-2 in the USA was cured by reception of intravenous RDV [114]. Due to adverse side effects, the appropriate dose of RBV in clinical setting should be given with caution.\nIn previous experience, for example in pandemic influenza A (H1N1), and avian influenza A (H5N1), passive immunization has been successful for treating of infectious complications [115]. A remarkable reduction in viral load and mortality was observed by using convalescent plasma therapy against severe acute viral respiratory infections, such as those created by CoVs [116]. Patients who have recovered from SARS-CoVs infection often have high titers of neutralizing antibody and may be a precious source of convalescent plasma. The FDA has also approved the administration of plasma from recovered individuals for treatment of severe COVID-19 patients [117].\nSARS-CoV-specific human monoclonal antibody (mAb) can bind potently with SARS-CoV-2 region. But, some of the most powerful SARS-CoV-particular neutralizing antibodies (i.e., m396) that target the ACE2 binding site of SARS-CoV did not bind to SARS-CoV-2 S-protein, indicating that the disparity in the RBD of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 has an important effect impact on the cross-reactivity of these mAbs, and so novel mAbs that specifically target SARS-CoV-2 RBD need to be designed [112].\nEffective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are urgently needed in order to reduce infection severity, viral shedding as well as human–human transmission, so assisting the control of the CoV outbreaks. Because S-protein and associated fragments, in other words RBD of SARS- and MERS-CoVs are the main targets for designing vaccines, it is speculated that homologous regions of SARS-CoV-2 can also be applied as prime targets for designing vaccines against this novel CoVs [118]. In addition, other conserved regions of SARS-CoV-2 including two subunits of the S-protein, M-protein as well as N-protein, can be applied as another potential target for design and development of effective vaccines.\nAntiviral vaccines can be categorized into two broad groups: DNA- and RNA-based vaccines, in which individuals are injected with genetically engineered plasmid containing the DNA molecule encoding the antigen against which an immune response is eligible, thus the cells machinery creates the antigen, leading to immunological response; and peptide- or protein-based vaccines that include whole-inactivated virus, individual viral proteins or subdomains, and purified or recombinant proteinaceous antigens proteins from the virus, all of which are manufactured in vitro.\nThe candidate vaccines that have recently entered clinical development include: mRNA-1273, Ad5-nCoV, INO-4800 and LV-SMENP-DC and pathogen-specific aAPC (Table 2). Several platforms have progressed to development with potential for rapid development, including DNA- and RNA-based platforms, followed by those for developing recombinant-subunit vaccines. RNA and DNA vaccines can be made quickly because they do not require culture or fermentation, instead using synthetic processes [119,120].\nEven with such promising platforms, SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development faces serious challenges. Although the virus’s S glycoprotein is a promising immunogen for protection, optimization of antigen design is crucial to obtaining an optimum host immune system response. Another concern is the possible exacerbation of lung disease, either directly or because of antibody-dependent enhancement due to the type 2 helper T-cell response. Furthermore, as with naturally acquired infection, the optimal duration of immunity is unknown; similarly, whether single-dose vaccines will confer lengthy immunity is doubtful.\nIn the early phases of the epidemic, early detection assists management of the disease and preventive approaches such as masks, hand hygiene compliances, prevention of public contact, voluntary home quarantine, early diagnosis, contact tracing, intelligence social distance and travel restrictions have been recommended to decrease transmission. Other approaches include limiting events that may facilitate superspreader potential including religious services (marriages and funerals) [121]. Many dimensions of the SARS-CoV-2 and corresponding disease are unknown. For instance, the role of ACE2 receptors in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis remains uncertain. Future studies should be concentrate on profound understating of replication, pathogenesis and biological properties applying the relevant biological methods in other words reverse genetics and molecular techniques. Genome wide association studies may provide an opportunity for the identification of potential genetic factors contributed in the development of COVID-19. Although host genetic studies are expensive and complex, more studies are required to determine the role of host genetics (such as variation in HLA genes) in the immune response to CoVs, and the clinical outcome of CoVs-mediated disease. Understanding of the SAR-CoV-2 viral genetics during the time and geography specially regarding to the number and repetition of viral mutations and recombination rates and their association with viral infectivity, transmissibility, severity of disease and clinical manifestation, viral load and disease outcome are important knowledge gaps that navigate our research timetable. Until now, no unique antiviral therapy has been approved; so treatment is mainly based on symptomatic therapy and best supportive care.\nThe zoonotic link of SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been definitively proven; although, phylogenetic analysis shows that SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to SARS-like bat CoVs. Lessons from other human outbreaks from pathogenic viruses such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and influenza viruses are very informative and valuable. Different wide-spectra antivirals agents previously used for treatment of influenza, SARS- and MERS-CoVs are under assessment for repurposing either monotherapy or in combinations to treat COVID-19 cases. SARS-CoV-2 is a novel human pathogen, and may interact with host antiviral defense via a specific pathway. Altogether, the infection and development of SARS-CoV-2 relies on the interplay between the virus and the patient’s immune response. Investigations of the area of SARS-CoV-2-host interplay provide response to many crucial questions in virus pathogenesis, disease control and prevention. At present, COVID-19 is leading to substantial global concerns. Development of valid, accurate and appropriate serological tests is urgently needed. It will be essential to quickly design and develop effective therapeutic regimen and vaccines to prevent or stop infection of this novel CoVs.\nThe COVID-19 has caused more infections and deaths compared with either SARS or MERS. According to R0 values, it is deemed that SARS-CoV-2 is more infectious than SARS or MERS. As imposition of globalization, CoVs will cause spreads and outbreaks with various mutant strains similarly in the coming years. With promotion of scientific collaboration, which is as a consequence of globalization, we may have more powerful means of combating CoVs, in which we characterize the genome structure and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection very well in the near future. A present treatment is mainly supportive, but trials of vaccines and antivirals are in progress. Differences in the length of the spike as it is longer in SARS-CoV-2 are likely to play a major role in the pathogenesis and treatment of this virus.\nRobust coordination and collaboration between researchers, vaccine developers, international regulators, policy-makers, financiers, national public health institutes and governments will be required to ensure that potential late-stage vaccine candidates can be produced in adequate amount with high safety and efficacy as well as equitably provided to all affected areas, specially low-resource regions.</br></br>UNKNOWN URL AND TITLE</br></br>\nAuthor Information\nAn event is serious (based on the ICH definition) when the patient outcome is:* death* life-threatening* hospitalisation* disability* congenital anomaly* other medically important event\n\nA 50-year-old man (Patient 1) and a 70-year-old man (Patient 2) developed acute tubular injury (ATI) and oxalate nephropathy during treatment with ascorbic acid for sepsis [durations of treatments to reactions onsets not stated].\nPatient 1: The man was admitted for persistent fever, cough and dyspnoea.

Lopinavir/ritonavir was rapidly switched to cobicistat/darunavir 150/800 mg/day. A single dose of SC tocilizumab was used to counteract cytokine storm. Considering his septic status, he received IV steroids and broad-spectrum antibiotics [specific drug not stated] therapy. He received a high-dose of IV ascorbic acid [vitamin C] 50 mg/kg four times a day for his septic status. He was put on enteral nutrition. His clinical course was complicated immediately by septic shock, requiring inotropes. He developed multi-organ failure with hepatic dysfunction as well as acute kidney injury (AKI) with anuria. Anuria was noted for 10 days. He was started on continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration on hospital day 2. He was treated with meropenem for Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteraemia. His respiratory status improved, and he was extubated by day 15 from admission. From day 18, swabs for SARS-CoV-2 were found to be negative. Despite an increase in urine output, his kidney function did not show any improvement and he was transferred to the nephrology unit. At day 36, a biopsy of the kidney was performed. At that time, his serum creatinine was 5.85 mg/dL and the urine output was 2000 mL/day. His kidney biopsy specimen showed extensive ATI and focal acute tubular necrosis, with degenerative and reactive aspects of tubular cells (epithelial attenuation and focal detachment with presence of cellular debris in tubular lumen). Additionally, calcium oxalate crystals (fan-shaped radially arranged translucent crystals on hematoxylin and eosin stain, birefringent when examined with polarised light) were identified in several tubular lumina. Few degenerated tubules contained periodic acid–Schiff–positive casts. There was mild focal interstitial inflammation; glomeruli showed no relevant alterations, apart from focal and segmental presence of inflammatory cells in capillary lumina; arteries and arterioles were normal. Immunohistochemical analysis characterised the inflammatory infiltrate as mild and mixed. Immunofluorescence on frozen tissue (immunostaining for IgG, IgA, IgM, complement component 3, complement component 1q, fibrinogen, kappa and lambda) was negative or nonspecific. Scanning electron microscopy on paraffin-embedded slides confirmed the presence of diffuse calcium oxalate monohydrate crystals in the tubular lumina, with a typical rose-cut–shaped appearance. Energy dispersive x-ray spectrometry showed a common calcium matrix in both kinds of crystals and identified a stoichiometric atomic ratio compatible with calcium oxalate monohydrate. Real-time PCR (performed according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines) on frozen kidney tissue was found to be negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. In the following days, a partial improvement in the kidney function was observed. He was discharged home on day 42. At the time of discharge, his serum creatinine was 4 mg/dL and the urine output was 1800 mL/day.\nPatient 2: The man was admitted for fever, diarrhoea and worsening neurologic status. His medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with metformin and long-acting insulin, arterial hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and mild liver steatosis. He had no history of kidney disease or kidney stones. On admission, a chest X-ray showed bilateral interstitial pneumonia and an oropharyngeal/nasal swab was found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2. His serum creatinine was normal (1.1 mg/dL). Because of worsening respiratory failure and rapid development of acute respiratory syndrome distress, he was immediately transferred to the ICU where he was intubated and put on lung-protective mechanical ventilation. According to the protocol for COVID-19, he was initiated on off-label treatment with hydroxychloroquine 400mg twice a day, cobicistat/darunavir 150/800 mg/day, lopinavir/ritonavir 200/50mg and <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightorange; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">azithromycin<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">chemical</span>\n</mark> 500 mg/day.

His clinical course was complicated immediately by persistent hypotension, requiring inotropes. He then developed progressive kidney dysfunction and needed kidney replacement treatment from hospital day 8. He underwent 11 continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration sessions with local citrate anticoagulation and was later switched to intermittent haemodialysis. His respiratory status improved, and he was extubated by day 15. Anuria was noted for 20 days. During admission, he received multiple antibiotic courses comprising piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftriaxone, linezolid, meropenem, daptomycin and oxacillin to treat supposed bacterial pulmonary superinfection and Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteraemia. He had a transient decrease in platelet count (attributed to prolonged linezolid treatment) and multifactorial anaemia requiring blood transfusion. Since day 22, he had a negative SARS-CoV-2 swab. Despite regaining adequate diuresis, kidney function failed to improve and haemodialysis was continued. He was transferred to the nephrology unit, and on day 45 a biopsy specimen of the kidney was performed. At that time, his serum creatinine was 6.5 mg/dL and the urine output was 3700 mL/day. The kidney biopsy specimen showed extensive ATI with marked coarse cytoplasmic vacuolisation in the tubular epithelial cells (interpreted as being caused by ischaemic injury), focal epithelial attenuation with thinning of the apical cytoplasm, focal tubulitis and diffuse presence of calcium oxalate crystals in the tubular lumen. Moderate focal interstitial inflammation was noted, more intense in areas of initial tubular atrophy; no glomerular abnormalities were identified; arteries showed mild intimal fibrosis and there were no signs of thrombotic microangiopathy. Immunohistochemical analysis characterised the inflammatory infiltrate as mixed, with an abundance of plasma cells and macrophages. Immunofluorescence analysis was negative or nonspecific. On transmission electron microscopy, degenerative alterations involving proximal and distal tubules and peritubular capillaries were identified; few tubular lumina were filled up by the footprint of crystal aggregates likely extracted during preparation for the biopsy procedure. The extensive vacuolisation of epithelial cells was confirmed; vacuoles contained amorphous material with low electron density, without evidence of structures suggestive for viral particles. No glomeruli were present in the examined material. Scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry analysis confirmed the presence of calcium oxalate monohydrate crystals. Real-time PCR (performed according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines) on frozen kidney tissue was found to be negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. After the biopsy procedure, polyuria was induced; kidney function showed slow improvement and there was no further need for haemodialysis. He was discharged home on day 58 after admission. At the time of discharge, his serum creatinine was 4.44 mg/dL and the urine output was 3900 mL/day.</br></br>UNKNOWN URL AND TITLE</br></br>\nAuthor Information\nAn event is serious (based on the ICH definition) when the patient outcome is:* death* life-threatening* hospitalisation* disability* congenital anomaly* other medically important event\n\nIn a study (WAYFARER Study), a 44-year-old man and a 62-year-old man were described, who exhibited pulmonary embolism (PE) or an increase in D-dimer, neutrophilia, lymphocytes or neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) during treatment with methylprednisolone and dexamethasone for COVID-19 pneumonia [not all routes stated].\nThe 44-year-old man, who was admitted on 22 April 2020 due to COVID-19 pneumonia.

However,instead of hydroxychloroquine, he was started on enoxaparin sodium, spironolactone 50mg twice a day and off-label bromhexine in a dose of 8mg four times a day. Until 28 April 2020, his condition gradually worsened. He was also receiving unspecified antibiotics, which were changed, whereas enoxaparin dose was increased. On 29 April 2020, his condition deteriorated critically. His D-dimer was 1.33 µg/mL and neutrophil count had increased to 7.55 × 109/L. Additionally, pronounced lymphopenia and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) of 16.06 were noted. Thereafter, he was transferred to the ICU and was started on adaptive lung ventilation (ALV). Considering his acute inflammation and the severity of the process, he was started on pulse therapy with IV methylprednisolone 1000mg for 3 days, which was later changed to dexamethasone 8mg twice a day for 5 days (off label). The patient also received colchicine prior to the discharge. After glucocorticosteroid therapy, a distinct anti-inflammatory effect was achieved, but an increase in D-dimer to 1.63 µg/mL, neutrophilia to 17.2 × 109/L and lymphocytes to 1.39 × 109/L was observed. His NLR decreased to 12.4. On the sixth day of glucocorticoid therapy, he was extubated, and on day 10, he was transferred from ICU. On day 14, he was discharged on colchicine and rivaroxaban treatment. A follow-up was scheduled on day 45.\nThe 62-year-old man was admitted due to COVID-19 pneumonia. At admission, his D-dimer level was 1.33 µg/mL with pronounced lymphopenia (0.34 × 109/L), neutrophilia (6.26 × 109/L) and high neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) of 18.4.

Following glucocorticoid therapy, a decrease in inflammatory markers and lung damage was observed. His lymphopenia persisted. However, an increase in D-dimer to 2.74 µg/mL and NLR to 20.6 was observed. The following day, his condition worsened with increased dyspnoea, chest pains and an increase in D-dimer to 13.52 µg/mL. A CT angiogram showed pulmonary embolism and the dose of unspecified low molecular weight heparin was further increased. Dipyridamole was added to the treatment.

Over the last 20 years (2000–2019), three modeling groups who access GPEI data as part of a data-sharing agreement created in 2013 (i.e. Kid Risk, Inc. (KRI, Orlando, FL), Imperial College (IC, London, United Kingdom), and the Institute for Disease Modeling (IDM, Seattle, WA)) performed the bulk of this polio modeling. The three groups largely work independently, which provides some confidence to the GPEI partners when the results from the groups agree. However, sometimes the groups provide conflicting results and recommendations. In addition, some other polio modeling papers also appeared in the published literature during this time.\nModeling poliovirus transmission can quickly become complex due to the three stable serotypes (i.e. 1, 2, and 3) and numerous strains. Live polioviruses (LPVs) exist in many forms, including wild polioviruses (WPVs), live, attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) strains, and OPV-related strains associated with evolution of the virus as OPV transmits through populations, causes secondary infections, and loses its attenuating mutations. OPV transmission can lead to the development of circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs), which result from the spread of OPV-related viruses in populations with low immunization coverage until the transmitting strains become fully reverted and behave like homotypic WPVs. In addition, in some rare instances, individuals with some B-cell-related primary immunodeficiencies can develop prolonged or chronic OPV infections, which evolves over the course of their infections, and they can potentially excrete (i.e. immunodeficiency-associated VDPVs (iVDPVs)). Consistent with no evidence of poliovirus transmission through a nonhuman vector and no environmental reservoir, transmission modeling focuses on person-to-person spread, with some models distinguishing between fecal-oral and oropharyngeal routes. All LPVs pose some risk of causing paralysis in fully susceptible individuals, although the probabilities (i.e. paralysis to infection ratios (PIRs)) range from substantial (i.e. on the order of 1 chance per 200 for WPVs) to very small (i.e. on the order of 1 chance per 1,000,000 for OPV). Paralysis cases that occur in fully susceptible OPV vaccine recipients or close contacts are called vaccine-associated paralytic polio (VAPP) cases. Notably, the PIRs (e.g. VAPP rates) and the transmissibility of LPV strains, as measured by their basic reproduction numbers (R0s), differ by serotype and strain. In addition, an inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) offers a second vaccine option, which can be given instead of or in addition to OPV. Both OPV and IPV appear to offer lifelong protection from paralysis after a single successful dose, although not every dose ‘takes’ and for OPV some competition can exist between the serotypes in multivalent formulations. Unlike for OPV, IPV recipients do not become infected with the vaccine strain. Consequently, they do not develop mucosal immunity and they cannot spread the vaccine secondarily (i.e. receipt of the IPV dose only protects the recipient). Adding even more complexity, individual immunity can wane and individuals can become reinfected and participate in transmission, with differences in the probabilities of infection and duration of excretion depending on the nature of their prior immunity. Although for most of the history of its use OPV included all three serotypes (i.e. trivalent OPV or tOPV), licensed formulations of monovalent OPV (i.e. mOPV) exist for each serotype (i.e. mOPV1, mOPV2, and mOPV3), and licensed bivalent OPV (i.e. bOPV) contains OPV for serotypes 1 and 3. The global certification of serotype 2 WPV (i.e. WPV2) eradication led to the globally coordinated cessation of serotype 2-containing OPV (i.e. OPV2) in 2016, which led countries that used tOPV prior to that time to switch to bOPV. As an inactivated vaccine, all IPV includes all three serotypes. Finally, individuals can receive vaccine either through routine immunization (RI), which follows a national schedule that delivers doses to children as they reach target ages and/or supplementary immunization activities (SIAs), which deliver doses to all individuals within a target age range over a short period of time, typically independent of prior immunization. SIAs include large, planned, and preventive SIAs (pSIAs) or reactive, outbreak response SIAs (oSIAs). As of early 2020, only serotype 1 WPV (i.e. WPV1) continues indigenous transmission (and only in Pakistan and Afghanistan), and global certification of serotype 3 WPV (WPV3) eradication occurred in October 2019. Since OPV2 cessation in 2016, serotype 2 cVPDVs (i.e. cVDPV2 s) have arisen in multiple countries despite pre-OPV2 cessation efforts to prevent them. Responses to these cVDPV2 outbreaks using mOPV2 imply ongoing transmission of OPV2-related strains.\nGiven the complexity of poliovirus immunity and multiple vaccine options, transmission and health economic modeling can provide insights that can support decision-makers as they evaluate different decisions and policy options. The GPEI partners implicitly value this type of modeling by engaging multiple modeling groups, and some prior studies documented the important role of modeling with respect to supporting some GPEI decisions [1–4]. Notably, however, we could not identify a comprehensive list of GPEI decisions, which makes it difficult to systematically document the decision-support provided by modeling. In addition, no systematic or comprehensive review of the polio modeling literature performed to support polio endgame risk management currently exists, and the different modeling groups tend to cite their own work (including the authors of this review) with limited reference to the independent work of the other groups. Furthermore, the published literature also includes relevant modeling studies by other authors. We sought to document the polio studies published by the different groups and to systematically review the nature of the polio transmission and economic modeling papers published in English for 2000–2019. Section 2 describes the methods we used to identify, code, and evaluate the literature. Section 3 summarizes the results of the systematic review. Section 4 provides a historical record of all of the polio-related studies published by the three GPEI-supported groups and summarizes the polio transmission models and economic models that we identified by other authors. Section 5 discusses cross-cutting themes addressed by multiple studies. Section 6 highlights differences in modeling approaches and methods. Sections 7 and 8 provide conclusions and expert opinion.\nWe searched Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, PA) and PubMed/Medline (United States National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD) for papers published in English after 1 January 2000 and before 31 December 2019 that included a combination of the terms: ‘polio*’ and ‘model*’ in their titles or abstracts. We screened the titles and abstracts of the search results to create a database of all studies that included mathematical modeling of poliovirus transmission and/or the economic evaluation of policies for risk management in the polio endgame. We evaluated the full text of papers for which the abstract did not contain sufficient information, and we excluded papers that did not include modeling of poliovirus transmission and/or economic analyses. We also reviewed the websites of the three modeling groups that support the GPEI partners: KRI [5], IC [6], and IDM [7]. We then added any missing polio-specific publications by the three GPEI-partner-supported modeling groups, including any that did not report on mathematical models of poliovirus transmission and/or economics related to risk management for the polio endgame. We included these papers to summarize the complete body of polio-related work published by the three modeling groups for 2000–2019. Figure 1 summarizes the search process.\n\nWe focused this review on the papers that reported the results of mathematical modeling of poliovirus transmission or economic analysis or their combination (i.e. integrated models). For each paper, we extracted the modeling group (i.e. KRI, IC, IDM, or other), publication year, and characterized the type of modeling performed or information reported. We applied the following hierarchy for characterization: (i) integrated modeling (i.e. including both dynamic transmission and economic modeling), (2) dynamic transmission models, subcategorized as a differential-equation-based (DEB), stochastic compartmental (SC), individual-based (IB), and/or discrete-event simulation (DES), (3) economic analyses, or (4) other, which only applied to some publications by the three GPEI-supported modeling groups, and which we only included to provide a historical record of the publications of these groups. We categorized the group of other papers as statistical or meta-analyses, which we subcategorized according to their focus on estimating risks, poliovirus transmission characteristics, vaccine effectiveness, or mucosal immunity, or as discussions of policy options, reviews, perspectives, or commentaries. This review excluded statistical analyses (e.g. exploration of risk factors, time-series analyses of incidence data) and discussions of policies, reviews perspectives, or commentaries, except those published by one of the three GPEI-supported modeling groups. As part of our review, we also identified topics of interest to the GPEI partners, which we found discussed by more than one of the three modeling groups.\nFollowing the search process shown in Figure 1, the systematic literature review and addition of other studies by the three GPEI-supported modeling groups led to the extraction of information from 176 included studies [1-4, 8-179]. As noted, during review of the full text of the studies identified by the search, we excluded papers that presented statistical analyses that did not include a mechanistic poliovirus transmission model [180–187].\nTable 1 summarizes some attributes of the included studies. Not surprisingly, the number of publications by each modeling group reflects the beginning of their efforts (i.e. KRI 78 papers since 2003, IC 46 papers since 2006, and IDM 19 papers since 2014). Similarly, as the number of modeling groups increased, so did the number of publications per 5-year time period (i.e. 5 papers 2000–2004, 22 papers 2005–2009, 45 papers 2010–2014, and 103 papers from 2015 to 2019). All of the modeling groups developed and applied some dynamic transmission models, although the extent of these efforts varied considerably. For example, only KRI combined dynamic transmission and economic modeling into integrated policy models and used all of the different types of dynamic transmission modeling tools (i.e. DEB, SC, IB, and DES). In addition, the three modeling groups tend to preferentially apply different modeling tools (i.e. DEB modeling dominates for KRI, SC for IC, and IB for IDM). We did not include studies that performed statistical simulation of infections (e.g. [136]) as dynamic transmission models. As shown in Table 1, all of the modeling groups also published papers that did not include transmission modeling or economic analyses. Notably, IC invested considerable efforts in characterizing vaccine effectiveness based on clinical trial and surveillance data, and on characterizing risks using statistical epidemiology to support inferences. Table 1 shows multiple reviews performed by all of the modeling groups to develop inputs for their transmission models. Table 1 also includes the contributions to the literature from others, which largely represent single papers, but with notable exception of multiple papers by Professor James Koopman (University of Michigan).\n\nTable 2 provides an overview of some of the attributes of the model structures and assumptions for the 83 papers that included a poliovirus transmission model [4, 9, 10, 14, 18–20, 22, 24–27, 33–36, 38–41, 43, 46, 47, 49–62, 64, 65, 68–71, 73–77, 81, 97–100, 129, 132–135, 147–171] organized by modeling group. Mathematical models for poliovirus transmission vary considerably in their complexity. The review identified papers that ranged from analytical exploration of theoretical issues using hypothetical populations for an average poliovirus to papers that simulated all of the complexity that comes with seasonal transmission of three serotypes of LPVs in populations with complicated national immunization strategies and histories. Table 2 shows the counts of and references for papers that modeled the transmission of outbreak viruses only, transmission of WPV, cVDPV, and/or OPV viruses, and those that included endogenous OPV evolution and model all LPVs. Table 2 also identifies the papers that included different attributes, including consideration of seasonality, specific-serotype transmission model inputs, OPV secondary spread, VAPP, both fecal-oral and oropharyngeal transmission routes, waning immunity, reinfection, and/or boosting OPV-induced immunity by IPV. With respect to mixing, Table 2 also captures whether each model included more than one age group and/or subpopulation and whether it included heterogeneous preferential mixing between age groups and/or subpopulations. With highly variable model structures, Table 2 identifies papers that included multiple immunity states to account for differences in immunity induced by OPV and IPV (in some cases as a function of the dose history), and immunity derived from maternal antibodies in infants. Table 2 also noted the papers with models that included one or more latent (i.e. infected but not infectious) stages and whether the models used a multi-stage infection process. DEB transmission models with a single stage for infection can lead to unrealistically short durations for many infections and long tails for others [188], which motivates the use of multi-stage infection processes in DEB models. SC models can avoid the issue of exponential departure rates from a single infection stage by using distributions instead of multiple stages (i.e. they simulate multi-stage infection processes more directly), and IB models may use time-varying functions for individual agents to model infections. DEB models can be solved analytically for some simple models or simulated numerically. SC models involve different types of stochastic simulation, which include following every single transition that occurs in the population with variable time steps [189], or using draws from an appropriate probability distribution (e.g. Poisson) to randomly determine the number of transitions that occur in the system during a fixed time step [188]. IB models simulate individual agents, and DES models track events. Remarkably, the review also identified a few theoretical papers that included an environmental reservoir, which is not consistent with the epidemiological experience with polioviruses. Finally, Table 2 also provides a high-level perspective on the types of immunization included in each paper by noting the studies that included OPV in RI, OPV in SIAs, IPV in RI, and IPV in SIAs, the studies that account for differences between various IPV and OPV RI schedules, and that account for the reality of repeatedly missing the same children during successive SIAs.\n\nTable 3 summarizes the populations considered by the 83 papers that included a polio transmission model [4, 9, 10, 14, 18–20, 22, 24–27, 33–36, 38–41, 43, 46, 47, 49–62, 64, 65, 68–71, 73–77, 81, 97–100, 129, 132–135, 147–171] organized by modeling group. The search process revealed a wide range of populations explored. KRI represents the only modeling group that developed and applied a global model, which relates to its focus on global policy. As shown in Table 3, multiple groups modeled the same countries, particularly the polio-endemic countries as of 2006 (i.e. India, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Afghanistan). For each entry, Table 3 shows the population size or time series of population size modeled (N) and the R0 used when reported (i.e. entries missing this information did not report it). Values of R0 depend on the population, model structure, and poliovirus serotype, so comparisons between different modeling groups for a given population should consider the different attributes of the models identified in Table 2.\n\nMotivated by an interest in appropriately integrating economic, risk, decision, and dynamic disease models to demonstrate the difference between static and dynamic policy models and the importance of changes that occur over time, KRI polio modeling efforts began in 2001 [17] with retrospective characterization of the economic benefits of polio risk management in the United States [9]. Informal discussions of the preliminary work on this topic in late 2001 with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) led to the establishment of a collaboration between KRI and CDC polio subject matter experts [17]. The KRI-CDC collaboration focused throughout the rest of the decade on the polio endgame (i.e. characterization of risks and risk management options for after WPV eradication). In 2003, KRI presented the decision options for post-WPV eradication policies [8] and developed a DEB dynamic transmission model for polio that included immunity states associated with WPV infection and vaccination with OPV and/or IPV, including transmission by individuals with asymptomatic infections [10]. Given the exclusive use of tOPV at that time, this transmission model used a generic poliovirus serotype and did not consider OPV evolution endogenously [10]. KRI focused on the global policy level and developed estimates of the costs for the different post-WPV-eradication decision options stratified by World Bank income levels (WBILs) to capture some important differences that exist between countries [11]. KRI also characterized the costs and value of the information from the global poliovirus laboratory network (GPLN), which supports global poliovirus surveillance [12]. KRI provided the first quantitative risk estimates for VAPP, cVDPVs, and iVDPVs [13]. The risk estimates appropriately varied by WBIL and type of poliovirus vaccine used by national immunization programs based on statistical analyses of available data at the time and as a function of different post-WPV eradication policies [13]. KRI used the transmission model [10] to explore post-WPV eradication outbreak response policies and provided key insights to the GPEI in 2005 [190] about the benefits of both pre- and post-WPV eradication outbreak response [14], which motivated investments in improvements in GPEI outbreak response activities. Many of these papers appeared in a 2006 special issue of Risk Analysis [15], which also included perspectives on risk management in a polio-free world [16] and on the history and nature of the collaborative modeling process used [17]. The retrospective economic analysis for the US showed significant (hundreds of billions of 2002 US dollars US$2002) in net benefits from US investments in polio immunization [9], which helped to strengthen US commitments to global polio eradication and risk management.\nFollowing the development of the integrated model components (i.e. dynamic disease transmission, risk, decision, and economic), KRI performed an economic analysis of post-WPV eradication immunization policies [18]. Given the time horizons considered in the economic analyses that extended beyond the characterization of outbreak events, the integrated model included consideration of potential reinfection and asymptomatic participation in transmission of individuals with waned immunity, with paralysis only occurring in a small fraction of fully susceptible individuals. High-level policy discussions related to control vs. eradication in late 2006 motivated KRI to apply the post-eradication model to estimate the economics of eradication (followed by several different post-WPV eradication immunization policies) compared to a wide range of control options [19]. This analysis demonstrated that eradication (if technically and operationally feasible in a reasonable time) represented a better health and economic option than control with OPV in OPV-using countries [19]. Some discussions at the time included significant pessimism about the ability to stop poliovirus transmission in India and the other remaining endemic countries [191]. KRI modeling suggested that elimination could occur in India with sufficient immunization intensity [19] and demonstrated that achieving eradication is a choice (i.e. the actions that countries and the GPEI take matter with respect to outcomes, and neither failure nor success could be taken as a given). KRI also demonstrated the economic inefficiency of a wavering global commitment to eradication [19]. The economic analysis of post-WPV eradication immunization policies showed that either stopping OPV altogether or switching to IPV dominated the continued OPV use (i.e. control) after successful eradication of WPVs [18]. However, using IPV after WPV eradication represented the option with the highest expected costs and the lowest expected cases, while stopping poliovirus immunization represented an option with lower expected costs and some additional expected cases, which led KRI to recommend research and investment into strategies to reduce IPV costs [18]. KRI performed extensive uncertainty and sensitivity analyses [20]. Recognizing the importance of OPV cessation as an option, KRI demonstrated the need for globally coordinated coordination of OPV cessation due to game-theoretic considerations associated with cVDPV risks that could occur with uncoordinated OPV cessation [21]. This analysis also highlighted the importance of creating a stockpile for post-WPV eradication outbreak response [21]. Due to the complexity and scale of the GPEI, KRI recognized the importance of managing the GPEI as a major project and ensuring sufficient resources for polio eradication to succeed [22]. KRI discussions about this work with GPEI partners highlighted the importance of the GPEI taking the long view and asking for the funds that it needed to succeed with a long-term budget and plan, instead of what it thought it could raise in annual budgeting cycles. Although not specific to polio, by extending a simple integrated theoretical model [192], KRI discussed uncertainty and sensitivity analyses for integrated models [193] and explored the dynamics of priority shifting for eradicable diseases [194], the latter of which also built on prior KRI analysis of a wavering commitment to eradication [19]. Recognizing the importance of a stockpile of OPV for post-WPV eradication outbreak response [21], KRI developed a framework for optimal stockpile design [23]. Although KRI primarily used DEB models, KRI developed an IB polio dynamic disease transmission model that showed the significance of different assumptions about mixing networks, which remain highly uncertain and difficult to model at the global level [24].\nIn 2010, KRI performed an economic analysis that estimated 40-50 billion US$2013 in net benefits for the GPEI for 1988-2035. The range of estimates depended on whether successfully coordinated OPV cessation following WPV eradication included global use of IPV or not (with the lower end of the range of net benefits (i.e. less desirable) reflecting the use of IPV) [25]. That analysis assumed successful WPV eradication in 2012 and considered the impacts of a delay out to 2015 [25]. KRI contributed to discussions about the role of economic analyses in the evaluation of global disease management efforts [195] and the development of eradication investment cases [196], in book chapters not captured by the systematic review. In 2012, KRI explored trends in the risks of poliovirus transmission in the US and recognized that imported live polioviruses could potentially circulate in a population with high IPV coverage, although the risks in the US appeared low [26]. KRI also explored the probability of undetected wild poliovirus circulation after apparent global interruption of transmission [27] (by extending a simple SC model [197] developed and applied in the mid-1990s to support certification of elimination of polioviruses in the Americas [197–199]).\nStill focused on post-WPV eradication and the polio endgame, as the GPEI immunization policies evolved, KRI appreciated the need to expand and update its integrated model. Specifically, as the GPEI began using mOPVs, first mOPV1 and then mOPV3, and later using bOPV (which contains both serotypes 1 and 3) for some SIAs, KRI needed to model the transmission of each serotype. KRI identified the need to model population immunity to transmission [1], and widely discussed its key role in prevention [200]. As part of its model update, KRI characterized the global immunization policy options as of 2012 and identified prerequisites for OPV cessation [28]. KRI developed a series of papers published in a 2013 special issue of Risk Analysis that described the components of its expanded and updated poliovirus transmission and OPV evolution model and discussed the role of modeling as part of the polio legacy [2]. KRI performed a comprehensive expert review of the literature on poliovirus immunity and transmission [29] and synthesized the information from the experts to (i) numerically characterize an expanded set of immunity states for its transmission model and (ii) identify significant uncertainties despite the large literature [30]. KRI reviewed the 2012 national polio immunization strategies to characterize updated prospective polio immunization policies and reviewed the seroconversion literature to characterize variability in vaccine take rates for different vaccines and numbers of doses in different settings [31]. KRI also updated its prior review of risks [13] and reviewed the literature related to understanding and modeling OPV evolution [32]. Based on this analysis [32], KRI concluded that its prior statistical model for cVDPV risks based on the historical global use of tOPV [13] offered poor predictive value of risks after the GPEI introduced mOPVs and bOPV. Specifically, the poor performance of the statistical model based on historical data [13] when compared with evidence at the time motivated KRI to include OPV evolution and the development of cVDPVs endogenously in its expanded poliovirus transmission and OPV evolution model (i.e. to use a dynamic and serotype-specific approach) [33]. KRI focused on the need to manage population immunity to transmission considering all individuals in the population, including individuals immune to disease but able to contribute asymptomatically to transmission, most notably those with only IPV-induced immunity [34]. The expanded model of poliovirus transmission and OPV evolution offered insights from modeling a diverse set of actual experiences with wild and vaccine-related polioviruses [33]. Overall, the expanded poliovirus transmission and OPV evolution model (i) uses eight recent immunity states to reflect immunity derived from maternal antibodies in infants, only IPV vaccination, only LPV infection, or both IPV vaccination and LPV infection (to more realistically capture the differences in immunity derived from IPV and LPV), (ii) includes multi-stage waning and infection processes (for more realistic characterization of these processes), (iii) characterizes OPV evolution as a 20-stage process from Sabin OPV (as administered) to fully reverted polioviruses with assumed identical properties to typical homotypic WPVs (to allow cVDPV emergence to occur within the model), (iv) characterizes each serotype separately (to analyze serotype-specific poliovirus properties, vaccination policies and risks), (v) considers explicitly both fecal-oral and oropharyngeal transmission (to account for the differential impact of IPV on fecal and oropharyngeal excretion), (vi) accounts for heterogeneous preferential mixing between mixing age groups and subpopulations, and (vii) accounts for differences between various IPV and OPV routine immunization schedules and the reality of repeatedly missed children during successive SIAs [33, 35, 36]. KRI also updated its estimates of IPV costs in the context of exploring national choices related to IPV use with various delivery options [37] and noted continued high expected costs of IPV.\nKRI used the updated and expanded integrated global model to identify optimal strategies from a modeling perspective (i.e. with respect to expected health and economic outcomes) to support the GPEI partners as they worked to implement the GPEI 2013–2018 Strategic Plan [201]. In 2014, KRI modeled the dynamics of coordinated cessation of serotype 2 OPV (OPV2) without [38] and with [39] IPV, which demonstrated the importance of using sufficient amounts of tOPV in the run up to OPV2 cessation to increase population immunity to transmission prior to OPV2 cessation [38]. Despite the GPEI emphasis on IPV introduction, these analyses also demonstrated the relatively small expected role of IPV in stopping or preventing transmission in areas with conditions conducive to poliovirus transmission (i.e. relatively high R0, high contribution of fecal-oral transmission, like the countries of interest to the GPEI) [39].\nGiven delays in achieving eradication and requests from the GPEI partners, starting in 2013 KRI began modeling pre-eradication activities and to explore options to help accelerate eradication. KRI applied its transmission model [33] to characterize the potential impact of expanding target age groups for polio SIAs [35] and to stop and prevent poliovirus transmission in two high-risk areas in northern India [36] and in the high-risk area of northwest Nigeria [40]. Considering potential US risks, KRI developed and applied an IB model to characterize the potential for transmission of polioviruses following an introduction of a LPV into the Amish communities in North America [41]. Consistent with prior recognition of the potential for circulation of imported LPVs in areas with high IPV-only coverage based on its US modeling [26], KRI modeled population immunity to transmission and management strategies for Israel following the observation of WPV serotype 1 transmission in Israel despite its high coverage with IPV only [43]. In contrast to some other areas in the US, KRI reported relatively little heterogeneity in six counties in Central Florida at high risk of importations due to international family entertainment attractions [44]. KRI discussed some lessons from the GPEI relevant to measles and rubella eradication [45]. Insights from KRI modeling showed the importance of focusing on immunization program performance (i.e. achieving high coverage with OPV) to maintain population immunity to transmission as the key to success in the polio endgame [42]. Many KRI modeling studies emphasized the failure to vaccinate with OPV as the primary cause of delay in achieving and maintaining WPV eradication, and the importance of heterogeneity in populations that leads to pockets of preferentially-mixing under-immunized individuals that can sustain transmission [35, 36, 40, 41, 43]. KRI provided a high-level review of the policy impacts of its modeling [3].\nIn 2015, KRI explored the information from different types of poliovirus surveillance activities and modeled the potential for undetected live poliovirus circulation after apparent interruption of transmission [46] based on earlier exploration [27]. KRI characterized global importations and cVDPVs since 2000 and showed that over 50 countries failed to maintain sufficient population immunity to transmission to prevent paralytic cases from cVDPVs and/or imported WPVs [47]. KRI also modeled three countries that use IPV-only for routine immunization (the US, the Netherlands, and Israel) and demonstrated the decline in population immunity in transmission that occurs when countries switch from using OPV to using IPV only. At the time of global introduction of IPV beginning in OPV-using countries, KRI discussed the safety of IPV and emphasized the potential benefits of using IPV as a first dose to reduce VAPP using data from the US experience [48]. Looking closely at northwest Nigeria, KRI explored the trade-offs associated with different strategies to manage population immunity to transmission that demonstrated the high importance of using more tOPV in SIAs in the run-up to OPV2 cessation and the minimal impact of IPV [49].\nKRI published a series of articles in a special issue of BMC Infectious Diseases in 2015 using its updated integrated model that aimed to help national, regional, and global health leaders navigate the polio endgame from 2013 to 2052. Modeling the long-term risks requires characterization of the potential for reintroductions of iVDPVs from a small number of individuals with B-cell-related primary immunodeficiencies [50], for which KRI reviewed the evidence collected since its 2006 statistical analysis [13]. KRI recognized that static modeling of historical data offered low predictive power for future iVDPV risks. As a result, KRI developed a DES model to support the stochastic generation of iVDPV excreters for prospective risk analyses and the exploration of the potential benefits of polio antiviral drugs (PAVDs) [50]. KRI used its iVDPV model and other stochastic risks related to containment in its integrated global model to characterize the risks, costs, and benefits of different future poliovirus risk management options for 2013–2052 compared to the 2013 baseline, which included continued widespread use of OPV for control [51]. Using both the global model [51] and a model of northern Nigeria [49], KRI showed the importance of vaccine choice and preferential use of tOPV in the run-up to globally coordinated cessation of serotype 2 OPV (i.e. OPV2 cessation), which was then-planned and since implemented in late April 2016 [52]. Recognizing the importance of significant tOPV use and sensitive to the time delays and costs of vaccine production, KRI estimated potential tOPV and bOPV needs through 2020 [53]. As global health policymakers approached the final decision point for establishing the timing of OPV2 cessation, KRI explored alternative OPV cessation and IPV introduction timing options [54] that showed substantial financial benefits associated with delayed IPV introduction. KRI demonstrated the importance of using aggressive and high-quality (i.e. rapid, high coverage, sufficiently large scope) outbreak response SIAs after OPV cessation and during the polio endgame [55]. In anticipation of coordinated OPV2 cessation, KRI explored the risks of potential non-synchronous OPV2 cessation [56] and of inadvertent tOPV use after OPV2 cessation [57]. Later work showed the potential risks of non-synchronous bOPV cessation and inadvertent use of serotype 1 or 3 OPV use after bivalent OPV cessation [58].\nUsing the updated integrated model [51], KRI performed an uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of cost assumptions [59] that continued to demonstrate the relatively high cost of IPV. Recognizing the importance of maintaining high population immunity for serotypes 1 and 3 prior for future coordinated bOPV cessation, KRI demonstrated the benefits of high levels of continued bOPV use and sustaining OPV production through bOPV cessation [60]. Building on prior characterization of iVDPV risks [50], KRI modeled the impact of comprehensive screening to find and treat asymptomatic iVDPV excretors and explored the impact of screening on the expected benefits of PAVDs [61]. KRI explored the potential benefits of investments in a new, ideal poliovirus vaccine assuming the best attributes of OPV and IPV [62]. Emphasizing the importance of actions taken by countries and the GPEI, KRI highlighted the importance of maintaining preparedness throughout the polio endgame [63]. KRI also demonstrated the minor role of IPV in outbreak response when used in conjunction with OPV, and showed that IPV in addition to OPV for outbreak response (in the outbreak area) does not represent a cost-effective option compared to using OPV alone [64]. KRI demonstrated the need to maintain sufficient poliovirus vaccine supplies and stockpiles for outbreak response in the polio endgame [65] and assessed the economic benefits of temporary recommendations for international travel immunization requirements for countries with transmission of WPV1 [66].\nRecognizing the increasing role of environmental surveillance for polioviruses, KRI systematically reviewed published poliovirus environmental surveillance studies and reported information related to the design, cost, and effectiveness of these systems [67]. KRI also explored the dynamics of die-out of serotype 2 polioviruses after homotypic OPV cessation and lessons learned from its cessation relevant to the cessation of OPV serotypes 1 and 3 [68]. Reviewing insights from prior modeling [35, 36, 40, 41, 43], KRI demonstrated how under-vaccinated subpopulations can sustain poliovirus transmission despite high coverage in the surrounding population, depending on the degree of mixing and the size of the under-vaccinated subpopulation [69]. Building on these lessons, KRI explored the potential for silent circulation of live polioviruses in small populations [70], and the role of hard-to-reach subpopulations in characterizing the confidence about the absence of transmission for purposes of certifying the eradication of WPV1 [71]. KRI revisited its earlier characterizations of containment risks [13, 51] and explored current containment risks and their management [72]. KRI also discussed the role of system dynamics in integrated polio risk management modeling [4].\nWith continued failure to stop transmission in Pakistan and Afghanistan as of 2016, KRI developed a model of both countries as one epidemiologically connected area [73]. Modeling poliovirus transmission in Pakistan and Afghanistan suggested that subpopulations of under-vaccinated individuals that preferentially mix with each other probably sustain transmission and that interrupting transmission requires a significant improvement in OPV SIA coverage in these under-vaccinated subpopulations [73]. Further modeling of poliovirus transmission in Pakistan and Afghanistan suggested the need for proactive strategies (as opposed to reactive ones) to stop poliovirus transmission [74], and KRI cautioned against getting distracted by the introduction of IPV from achieving high coverage with OPV SIAs. Exploration of the potential for silent poliovirus transmission in Pakistan and Afghanistan [75] showed the role of surveillance in providing confidence about the absence of transmission. Tradeoffs in key characteristics of the poliovirus surveillance system in Pakistan and Afghanistan [76] suggest some role of environmental surveillance in assuring confidence about the absence of transmission, although KRI identified the need for further characterization of the quality of the information from polio surveillance in Pakistan and Afghanistan to fully explore the benefits of investments in environmental surveillance.\nLooking prospectively at the polio endgame given failure to succeed in the GPEI objectives by 2018, KRI discussed the role of different poliovirus risks and risk management opportunities [72], and the potential risks of needing to restart OPV [77]. KRI also reflected on the role of integrated modeling to support the global eradication of vaccine-preventable diseases [4].\nIn 2019, KRI updated its cost estimates of the GPLN including both acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) and environmental surveillance [78]. KRI characterized the impact of hard-to-reach subpopulations on confidence about no undetected circulation in the context of supporting global certification of wild polioviruses [71]. Building on prior recognition of the potential role of a new vaccine [62], KRI commented on an article that reported the results of a new OPV2 vaccine strain (nOPV2) [79] and explored the logistical challenges of modeling and implementing a restart of OPV after its cessation [80].\nAlthough outside of the time window for this review, in early 2020, KRI published an updated version of its integrated model to account for the programmatic experience, vaccination achieved, and epidemiology through 2019 [202]. This process included updating the inputs for its iVDPV risk model [81], and focused on actual and expected performance throughout the polio endgame instead of assuming optimistic and ideal risk management from 2015 on [203] as KRI assumed earlier [51].\nStarting in 2006, IC began reporting on its application of advanced epidemiological methods to support the GPEI as part of its collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO). IC focused on statistical analyses of existing data and data collected as part of prospective clinical trials or challenge studies and did not perform any economic analyses. With respect to transmission modeling, between 2000 and 2019, IC applied dynamic transmission models to explore several specific topics. In 2013, using a simple DEB and SC model on two hypothetical populations, IC explored IPV use after OPV cessation, which suggested that IPV would protect children from paralysis, and under some conditions, IPV use could potentially limit transmission [97]. The study also noted that IPV use in routine immunization could also potentially delay the detection of outbreaks and allow transmission to spread further by preventing AFP cases [97]. In 2014, IC used an SC model to explore the impact of older age groups on the transmission of polioviruses, which identified faster outbreak response as substantially more important than expanding the age range of campaigns [98]. IC applied the same SC model in 2017 to explore a statistical inference framework to epidemiological and genetic data collected during a poliovirus outbreak to estimate transmission parameters [99]. Using an SC model for Nigeria, in 2016 IC characterized the role of tOPV SIAs before OPV2 cessation and suggested that in closed populations with no routine immunization coverage, conducting tOPV SIAs with some characteristics (e.g. one SIA with low coverage) could increase cVDPV2 risks after OPV2 cessation [100]. The inclusion of low routine immunization coverage in the model suggested the need for a sufficient number of focused tOPV SIAs before OPV2 cessation in areas at risk of VDPV2 emergence to raise population immunity above the transmission threshold [100].\nIC also used statistical models to characterize transmission dynamics. Using data from Nigerian nonpolio AFP cases, IC applied a Poisson mixed effects model to characterize the connections between local government areas (LGAs) and suggested that a radiation model of human mobility provided the best fit [101]. IC applied a similar model to data from Pakistan and found that movement dynamics did not provide strong predictors for future cases and highlighted the necessity of improved SIA quality [102].\nIC performed multiple case–control studies that estimated the efficacy of poliovirus vaccines using nonpolio AFP surveillance data collected by the GPLN, many of which supported GPEI decisions to introduce additional poliovirus vaccine formulations (e.g. mOPV1, bOPV, IPV) as new tools that would accelerate eradication. The first case–control study published by IC estimated the efficacy of tOPV vaccine in India, with a focus on areas with high population density and poor sanitation (i.e. Uttar Pradesh and Bihar) in which poliovirus transmission remained endemic [82]. This analysis showed poor tOPV efficacy per dose in these areas and suggested that using some mOPV1 SIAs in these areas could help to stop WPV1 transmission without significantly increasing WPV3 risks [82]. Subsequent case–control studies estimated vaccine efficacy of mOPV1 on the order of three times higher for serotype 1 poliomyelitis disease than for tOPV for Uttar Pradesh and Bihar [83] and for polio-endemic areas in northwest Nigeria [84]. Building on this work, IC led a challenge study in northern India to assess mucosal immunity induced by OPV, which demonstrated significant differences by location, serotype, vaccine formulation, and the number of doses [85]. IC assessed rates of excretion of live polioviruses (wild and OPV-related) in asymptomatic children in contact with suspected cases as a function of age, OPV doses received, and characteristics of the suspected case, which confirmed some asymptomatic participation in WPV transmission by OPV-vaccinated children [86]. Following the introduction of mOPV1 and mOPV3 in SIAs in Nigeria, IC compared the clinical characteristics of reported polio cases, estimated vaccine efficacy for different OPV vaccine formulations, and highlighted the improvements in vaccine-induced immunity against serotypes 1 and 3 and the decline in immunity to serotype 2 in children 0–2 years of age, which resulted in increased observations of cases caused by cVDPV2s [87]. IC explored the duration of mucosal immunity induced by OPV in India and suggested that it wanes significantly within 1 year [88].\nFollowing the introduction of bOPV, in 2012, IC performed a case–control study using data from young children in Pakistan and Afghanistan that reported comparable effectiveness of bOPV to mOPV1 for serotype 1 and commented on the poor and declining immunization coverage in these countries [89]. In 2014, IC reported on the results of trials in India that demonstrated that the delivery of a supplemental IPV dose to previously-OPV-vaccinated children <5 years old boosted their intestinal immunity [90], and does so more effectively than a supplemental OPV dose [91]. Following this study cohort, in 2017 IC reported that the duration of boosting by IPV of intestinal immunity in OPV-vaccinated children remained elevated for 6 and 11 months, but showed evidence of waning [103]. Using data from Nigeria, in 2014 IC explored the vaccine effectiveness for the different formulations of OPVs in use (i.e. mOPVs, bOPV, tOPV) and suggested that immunity in children <3 years old to serotypes 1 and 3 had improved with the use of mOPVs and bOPV [92]. In 2016, using data from Indian infants 5–11 months old, IC reported that the number of tOPV doses received represented the main determinant of serotype 3 seropositivity [104], and <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightpink; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">reported<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">trials</span>\n</mark> results from a clinical <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightpink; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">trial<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">trials</span>\n</mark> that suggested that a 3-day <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightgreen; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">course<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">usages</span>\n</mark> of <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightorange; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">azithromycin<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">chemical</span>\n</mark> prior to delivery did not improve the immunogenicity of mOPV3 [105]. In 2018–19, using this same population, IC reported findings that showed a correlation between the quantity of virus shed and the magnitude of the serum neutralizing antibody response at 21 or 28 days [106], showed a greater impact on OPV response by enteric viruses than bacterial microbiota [107], and that did not show an association between seroconversion from one dose of mOPV3 and FUT2 genotype (i.e. single-nucleotide polymorphisms G428A, C302 T, and A385 T) [108].\nIn addition to analyzing results from clinical trials and challenge studies, IC also developed statistical models to characterize risks and effectiveness of some interventions by analyzing available data. In 2011, to explore the widespread transmission of WPVs in Africa, IC applied a statistical model that identified the proximity to the continued transmission in Nigeria and poor performance of national immunization programs in some neighboring countries as risk factors for transmission of reintroduced WPVs in Africa [93]. In 2017, IC revisited this topic for both Africa and Asia, concluded that low population immunity represented a key risk factor for WPV or cVDPV transmission, and recommended maintenance or improvement of vaccination in the high-risk areas it identified [109]. In 2015, IC applied a statistical model to estimate the effectiveness of SIAs using nonpolio AFP cases reported for children <2 years old in Pakistan, which showed temporal changes in coverage and identified some under-vaccinated populations [110]. Building on this work, in 2016 IC characterized spatial and temporal trends in vaccine-induced population immunity for serotype 2 for Nigeria and Pakistan prior to OPV2 cessation to explore the need for additional serotype 2-containing vaccines [111]. In 2016, using retrospective surveillance data, IC suggested that developing a real-time database of notified AFP cases and applying a Poisson space-time scan statistic at weekly intervals could potentially lead to earlier outbreak response [112]. In 2017, a year after OPV2 cessation IC analyzed the surveillance data and concluded that high population immunity prior to OPV2 cessation facilitated the die out of serotype 2 OPV-related viruses in most areas, but that cVDPV2 circulation continued in areas at high risk for transmission [113]. IC also performed a statistical analysis that explored the impacts of using IPV in addition to OPV for outbreak response in Pakistan and Nigeria and suggested some benefit of using IPV although the results were not statistically significant [114] and an updated analysis for Pakistan in 2018 [115]. In 2018, IC analyzed different sources of routine immunization data in Pakistan that showed both variable data quality and heterogeneous coverage [116] and assessed the sensitivity of poliovirus surveillance (both AFP and ES) for serotype 1 [117].\nBetween 2000 and 2019, IC also contributed a number of reviews to the literature. Recognizing the wealth of studies published over decades, IC systematically reviewed the OPV challenge studies that evaluated the induction of immunity from OPV and/or IPV against shedding, which concluded that immunization with IPV would likely show limited impact on poliovirus transmission in countries characterized by fecal-oral poliovirus transmission [94]. IC discussed some of the challenges for the polio endgame with a focus on issues related to OPV vaccine failure [95], results of clinical trials performed by others that added IPV to routine immunization schedules in OPV-only using countries [118, 119] including potential impacts of IPV on mucosal immunity [120], and showing no benefits of adding IPV in mOPV2 outbreak response SIAs [121]. IC also commented on biological challenges that limit the effectiveness of vaccines in the developing world, including OPV [122], and the need for innovation in poliovirus surveillance, vaccines, and vaccination strategies [123]. IC also systematically reviewed IPV vaccine effectiveness studies [96] and the impact of IPV on mucosal immunity [124], and suggested that IPV use could play a key role in halting poliovirus transmission and hasten polio eradication due to boosting of immunity of individuals previously given OPV [124]. IC also systematically reviewed the characteristics of known iVDPVs [125], interventions to improve oral vaccine performance [126], and the effect of different vaccine schedules on humoral and intestinal immunity against poliovirus [127].\nIDM, an institute within the Global Good Fund, is a collaboration between Intellectual Ventures and Bill and Melinda Gates. IDM established a GPEI-partner collaboration with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 2011. IDM published its first polio model-related work in 2014 in a review of poliovirus infection and immunity, which it discussed in the context of developing inputs for use in an individual-based model [128]. Using an IB mathematical model, IDM explored the use of expanded age groups in SIAs and concluded that these would not significantly improve the prospects of achieving polio eradication [129]. In 2016, IDM used an IB model of children <5 years old in Kano, Nigeria, which suggested a high probability of elimination of transmission of WPV1 from Kano as of October 2015 [132]. In 2017, IDM applied an IB model of a hypothetical cVDPV2 outbreak response in northwest Nigeria, which suggested that the use of mOPV2 for outbreak response could seed new cVDPV2 lineages as early as 18 months after OPV2 cessation [133]. This analysis discussed the importance of rapid and aggressive outbreak response and the potential role of IPV, including the possibility of its use delaying detection of an outbreak [133]. In 2018, IDM described another IB model in detail and demonstrated the ability of the model to reproduce historical outbreaks in different transmission settings based on historical data [134]. IDM used this extensive and well-documented IB model to explore the stability of polio eradication after the withdrawal of OPV [134]. This analysis highlighted the fragility of eradication and the importance of strategies to stop any post-cessation outbreaks and the potential need for new vaccine tools, while suggesting a limited role for IPV in high transmission settings [134]. Building on this work, IDM used the results of a field trial in Bangladesh designed to collect fecal shedding data after mOPV2 challenge and this IB model to explore community transmission of OPV2-related viruses after OPV2 cessation, which suggested an increase in transmission risk over time after OPV2 cessation [135].\nIDM also performed multiple statistical analyses using GPLN data. In 2014, IDM discussed the use of lot quality assurance sampling (LQAS) to evaluate the quality of SIAs [130] and used Nigerian AFP surveillance data to predict the risks of cases at the district level [131]. In 2015, IDM also developed a simple statistical model of the polio force of infection using data from Nigeria and based on anticipated die out of all wild poliovirus transmission in Nigeria in 2015 [136]. IDM provided a perspective on the application of advanced digital tools (e.g. GIS tracking) to fight polio and other communicable diseases [137]. In 2015, IDM also applied a heuristic algorithm to spatially reconstruct partially observed transmission networks using phylogenetic data for northern Nigeria and found substantial limitations of the method due to under-sampling [138]. Building on this work, in 2016 IDM characterized OPV revision using whole-genome sequencing data from Nigeria, which showed some evidence of transient and local transmission of OPV-related serotype 1 and 3 viruses during periods of low wild polio incidence that appeared consistent with national OPV use [139]. IDM performed a statistical analysis of immunization data to characterize OPV-induced population immunity and assess campaign effectiveness in high-risk countries to support GPEI SIA planning activities [140]. Using data from Nigeria, IDM constructed a hierarchical model to estimate SIA effectiveness to characterize OPV-induced immunity and compared these estimates to data from LQAS and incidence data [141]. Using these methods, in 2017, IDM reported spatial risk model predictions and recommended subnational prioritization to accelerate poliovirus elimination in Pakistan [142]. Following OPV2 cessation, IDM compared pre- and post-cessation detection rates of cVDPV2s and showed the die out of OPV2-related viruses in most countries [143].\nIn 2018, IDM reviewed its applications of IB modeling for multiple pathogens, including polio [144]. IDM also used data from Pakistan and Afghanistan to assess the sensitivity of poliovirus environmental surveillance [145]. In 2019, IDM reported the results of a cost study that compared polio eradication to indefinite control with 2 doses of IPV and multiple doses of OPV in currently OPV-using countries [146].\nIn 2001, one study used a DEB model to characterize poliovirus transmission as part of an analysis that explored the probability of detecting poliovirus in sewage water as a function of different transmission conditions (e.g. equilibrium and non-equilibrium) [147]. Building on DEB modeling performed and applied prior to 2000 [204, 205], one 2001 study reported the application of a simple DEB model to characterize the expected infections and cumulative infections as a function of time since poliovirus introduction into a naïve population as a function of different net reproduction numbers ([148] see Annex). Although not captured in the review, additional perspectives by the same author published since 2000 addressed challenges for the polio endgame [206, 207], risk factors for the severity of outbreaks after eradication [208], and characterization of the extent of VDPV infections [209].\nA 2005 study used a DEB model to characterize WPV in the absence of vaccines, which characterized polio as a disease of development (i.e. a disease that becomes worse as hygienic conditions improve such that individuals become infected at relatively older ages when the symptoms present as more severe) [149]. In 2008, following widespread recognition of cVDPVs, one study applied a DEB model to explore three alternative eradication strategies using pulsed OPV or continuous or pulsed IPV immunization and different levels of coverage [150]. However, this theoretical analysis ignored the benefits of secondary transmission of OPV and the complexity of reinfection and included simple modeling of the reversion of OPV given to vaccine recipients, which the authors refer to as cVDPVs but which behave more like VAPP [150]. A 2010 study by the same authors applied a DEB model that included secondary OPV transmission, which explored continuous and pulsed OPV immunization strategies [151]. A 2011 simple theoretical DEB model assumed that IPV can precipitate paralysis in a patient already incubating a poliovirus infection, and suggested sick and unimmunized children should not receive IPV during polio epidemics [152].\nIn 2012, a comprehensive theoretical DEB model that included OPV secondary infections, OPV evolution, and IPV use explored the dynamics of OPV cessation and the probability of eradication [153]. A 2013 study applied a DEB model that considered waning immunity and showed how countries with high transmission conditions remain at risk for epidemics from the reintroduction of WPV, which offered some explanation for challenges that prevented successful poliovirus elimination in some countries [154].\nIn 2015, two independent theoretical studies used DEB models to characterize the dynamics of OPV and cVDPV transmission in populations as a function of coverage and the competition for infectible individuals [155, 156]. One of these studies included an IB version of the model to simulate die out and discussion of the dynamics of small population sizes [155]. Another study in 2015 applied a simple DEB model to highlight the increasing role of reintroduction of polioviruses by travelers [157]. Another study applied an SC model to fit an SIR model to pre-vaccine US incidence data to infer WPV infection dynamics and variable time and space R0 estimates [158], which concluded that contrary to a prior study [149], polio does not appear to be a disease of development. Assuming the existence of an environmental reservoir for live polioviruses, one study characterized the impacts of different pulse vaccination strategies in a DEB metapopulation model and highlighted the importance of synchronization [160].\nIn 2016, one study explored the ability to detect polio cases in populations with high IPV coverage, which highlighted that asymptomatic infections may mask live poliovirus transmission and suggested longer delays to detection as vaccine coverage and/or the proportion of the population with only IPV vaccination increases [210]. Revisiting a simple theoretical model of silent circulation developed in the mid-1990s [197] and reconsidered by KRI in 2012 [27], a 2016 analysis emphasized further limitations of the simple model with respect to consideration of the vaccination history [161]. Modeling the experience with WPV1 reintroduction into Israel, one study used a DEB model to characterize the importance of using OPV to interrupt WPV transmission in a developed country with very high IPV coverage [162]. A theoretical DEB model highlights OPV as an example of a weakly transmissible vaccine for which the transmissibility of the vaccine can help with global eradication efforts [211].\nOne study in 2017 applied a DEB model to explore the implications of using a deployment-risk-based immunization strategy (i.e. to polio-endemic areas) for US military personnel and nondeployed US military populations [163]. Focusing on the dynamics of a hypothetical importation of WPV1 from Syria into Lebanon in 2013 to explore the potential benefits of an OPV SIA conducted in Lebanon in November 2013, a 2017 study developed an IB model that demonstrated the importance of the preventive SIA with respect to preventing a potentially large and explosive outbreak [159].\nConsidering the potential impacts of importations of poliovirus into IPV-using countries by large groups of immigrants, a 2017 analysis used a DEB model to explore the vaccination required in both groups to stop transmission [164].\nKoopman and colleagues published multiple modeling papers between 2017 and 2019. The first study built on earlier work [154] although the 2017 analysis used a relatively simpler DEB model with much more extensive analysis of waning immunity and suggested potential challenges associated with OPV cessation due to potential silent poliovirus transmission in some areas and the potential role of environmental surveillance [165]. A separate study applied a DEB model to the importation of WPV1 in Israel and emphasized the importance of environmental surveillance [166]. A series of three papers used SC models to explore the potential for undetected transmission in theoretical small and isolated populations [167], the impact of using unrealistically high values for the basic reproduction number that limited generalization of the prior results [168], and an extension of an independent reanalysis [70] of the first paper [167] to include different assumptions about waning [169].\nRecently, a 2018 study applied an IB model calibrated to stool shedding data from communities in Mexico to explore the impacts of using OPV for outbreak response 5 years after OPV cessation [170]. In 2019, one theoretical DEB modeling exercise explored the potential role of human exposure to polioviruses from the environment [171].\nAlthough not captured by the systematic search or included in the review, readers may also find other polio models published prior to 2000 of interest. These include a DEB model of an outbreak in Taiwan [212], DEB models to support eradication planning published in 1994 [213] and 1996 [198], and three papers published in 1995–6 related to undetected circulation at the time of certification [197, 199, 214].\nThe systematic search identified some additional economic analyses, and we include mention of others known to the authors. For example, the search did not find a 2003 study that estimated the costs and benefits of polio eradication by WHO region [215] or a 2004 cost analysis of potential post-eradication polio immunization policies [216], and by design, we missed economic analyses of polio eradication published prior to 2000 [217, 218]. The search included one 2000 analysis that explored pricing for combination vaccines that included IPV in the US [172]. One 2001 study reported that introducing IPV in Australia did not appear cost-effective [173], which reached conclusions similar to 1988 [219, 220] and 1996 [221] studies for the US. The search did not capture other studies that reached similar conclusions for IPV introduction in 2006 for South Africa [222] or in 2008 for OPV-using countries generally [223]. The search also did not find a 2005 study for Mexico [224] or a 2017 study for India [225] that suggested that stopping OPV SIAs and eliminating their costs could potentially off-set the costs of IPV introduction. The search captured two economic analyses published in 2006 that reported decision analysis results comparing vaccine options for responding to a poliovirus outbreak in the US from a vaccine stockpile [174] and comparing pre-vaccination serological testing vs. presumptively vaccinating internationally adopted and immigrant infants in the US [175]. The search also identified an economic analysis that explored the incentives of individual countries to participate in global polio eradication with consideration of post-eradication risks [176], which built on prior related studies by the same author not captured in the search [226, 227]. The search did not include a subsequent 2013 discussion of the multiple economic games occurring in the final stages of polio eradication [228]. The search included a 2014 study that found that switching from 10-dose to 5-dose vials of IPV reduced wastage but did not appear cost-saving for the studied vaccination facilities in Bangladesh, India (Uttar Pradesh), Mozambique, and Uganda [177]. A 2015 review of economic analyses related to disease elimination and eradication initiatives included a number of studies included in the search, but did not appear in the search results [229]. The search identified a 2016 study that estimated the health and economic benefits of three decades of polio elimination investments in India [178]. Finally, the search captured a 2017 study that reported on the GPEI costs associated with supporting tOPV-using countries as they switched to bOPV [179]. The search did not capture a 2019 study that reported the cost per child vaccinated with full versus fractional-dose IPV [230].\nWe found consistency in the recommendations made independently from different transmission modeling studies [14, 35, 43, 55, 98, 133, 162, 166] with respect to the importance of rapidly detecting and responding to outbreaks. Multiple studies also recommended that in the event of detection of a transmitting virulent virus (i.e. WPV or cVDPV) after OPV cessation, using OPV for outbreak response offered the best option [14, 35, 52, 55, 68, 133, 134], although its use comes with risks. Specifically, all three modeling groups expected the risks associated with using OPV for outbreak response after OPV cessation would increase as a function of the time since cessation (i.e. as more birth cohorts without exposure to LPVs accumulate). The modeling motivated the creation of mOPV vaccine stockpiles for outbreak response after OPV cessation to ensure sufficient supplies. For the review inclusion time (2000–2019), only KRI applied transmission modeling to questions related to creating, funding, and managing stockpiles of poliovirus vaccines [21, 23, 53, 65, 77], although one economic analysis considered the US stockpile [174].\nAll three modeling groups gave similar recommendations to the GPEI partners based on the application of transmission models in response to questions about the potential benefits of using expanded age group as the target for SIAs [35, 98, 129]. Notably, although the populations modeled by the groups differed, the primary conclusions of the application of transmission models to the question of expanding the target age ranges for OPV SIAs emphasized the importance of reaching susceptible children (typically the younger ones and those in undervaccinated subpopulations) as quickly as possible. Some of the modeling groups also highlighted the substantially lower cases (and costs) associated with performing pSIAs to prevent the need for oSIAs [34, 35, 159].\nAll of the modeling groups recognize the need for high population immunity to achieve and maintain polio eradication. However, one of the most notable sources of conflicting recommendations from the three modeling groups comes from the use of different definitions for population immunity. As shown in Table 4, all three modeling groups used the term ‘population immunity’ in numerous 2000–2019 publications. The KRI papers that mention population immunity use a dynamic transmission model that focuses on the characterization of the transmission of infections based on the understanding that eradication requires achieving and maintaining the end of all LPV transmission (i.e. permanent prevention of infection). As such, KRI defines ‘population immunity to transmission’ for each serotype as dynamic measure of the overall immunity by serotype of all individuals in a population, including partial immunity for those with prior vaccination or infection who can become (re)infected and participate in transmission due to the nature or waning of their immunity. In contrast, statistical and epidemiological models developed by IC defined population immunity differently, even from paper to paper depending on the research question and data used, see note at the bottom of Table 4, which indicates the serotype-specific definitions applied in some papers. The IC concept of population immunity focuses on vaccine coverage and prevention of paralysis (instead of infection). While this narrower concept of population immunity provides an indication of susceptibility to transmission in an important part of the population (i.e. young children) and can characterize variability in relatively small geographic areas (e.g. districts), it excludes the (i) the immunity of young children induced by exposure to WPVs, secondary spread of OPV-related viruses, and cVDPVs, (ii) serotype-specific immunity in some instances (particularly when countries use mOPV or bOPV), (iii) differences in the nature of immunity induced by OPV and IPV, and/or (iv) the potential role of older children and adults in transmission. The IDM papers that discuss population immunity also focus on vaccine coverage in young children. In the review, we noted two other modeling studies that mentioned population immunity [155, 162]. Although not captured by the review, a study of the impact of SIAs in the Democratic Republic of the Congo also estimated population immunity and emphasized the importance of achieving and maintaining high population immunity [231].\nAll three modeling groups provided recommendations to the GPEI related to OPV2 cessation. KRI integrated modeling [18] helped to support the GPEI establishment of a 2008 global agreement to stop OPV use after WPV eradication [232], and to do so with globally coordinated OPV cessation and with the contingency of mOPV vaccine stockpiles for outbreak response [21]. Despite delays in achieving WPV eradication, later integrated analyses reaffirmed this strategy [51, 54], while also emphasizing the need to carefully manage the risks associated with OPV cessation and to ensure sufficient OPV vaccine supplies [52, 53]. In preparation for OPV cessation, KRI applied DEB modeling to explore OPV cessation dynamics and recommended that the GPEI partners increase population immunity to transmission for serotype 2 to stop any existing cVDPV2s and prevent the creation of future cVDVP2s prior to globally coordinating OPV2 cessation by intensifying tOPV pSIAs [26, 38, 39, 49, 52–54, 68]. IC used an SC model to explore theoretical concepts related to OPV cessation dynamics [100]. When first presented to the GPEI partners, this modeling initially did not consider the seeding of OPV2 from routine immunization in all tOPV-using countries, which led IC to recommend caution about tOPV pSIAs and contrasted with the recommendations from KRI [38, 39]. However, in its published results, IC considered tOPV use in routine immunization, and supported the strategy of ‘focused tOPV SIAs before OPV2 withdrawal in areas at risk of VDPV2 emergence and in sufficient number to raise population immunity above the threshold permitting VDPV2 circulation’ [100]. A separate statistical analysis by IC supported the GPEI decision to globally coordinate OPV2 cessation in 2016 based on its assessment and expectations about population immunity for Nigeria and Pakistan [111]. After OPV2 cessation, IC and IDM performed statistical analyses that reported that the high population immunity achieved in most areas helped with the prevention of cVDPV2s [113, 143], while also noting problem areas. KRI and IDM characterized the expected increasing vulnerability of populations to transmission of serotype 2 LPVs as a function of time after OPV2 cessation and the risks posed by reintroductions of LPVs from multiple potential sources, including the risks of using mOPV2 use for outbreak response [56–58, 60, 133]. After OPV2 cessation, in a review of lessons learned KRI emphasized the importance of reaching under-vaccinated subpopulations [69], characterized the probabilities of potentially needing to restart OPV2 vaccine production and use on a large scale [77], and discussed the complex vaccine choices and logistics of managing vaccine supplies [80]. Several studies by others also explored the dynamics of OPV cessation and the risks of reestablished transmission [153, 170].\nNumerous studies explored the role of IPV use after OPV cessation [18–20, 25, 28, 33, 39, 51–60, 64, 65, 68, 69, 73–77, 80, 90, 91, 94, 97, 103, 114, 115, 118–120, 122, 133, 150, 153, 164], primarily related to IPV use in routine immunization after WPV eradication. These studies included consideration of the use of IPV in oSIAs, which represents a topic on which the modeling groups offered different recommendations [51, 55, 64, 68, 133, 150, 164]. Notably, KRI does not recommend the use of IPV for oSIAs in OPV-using countries except when homotypic OPV is not available, because adding IPV to oSIAs is not effective and not cost-effective based on its DEB and integrated modeling [64]. In contrast, IC suggests that adding IPV may offer some benefit based on statistical modeling of observational data [106, 114]. The health and economic benefits of using IPV in routine immunization in OPV-using countries differ substantially before and after homotypic OPV cessation. Giving IPV doses sequentially before OPV doses in a national immunization schedule can eliminate VAPP, which is important in high- and upper middle-income countries that achieve high coverage and want to minimize risks associated with vaccine use. In contrast, for countries with relatively lower coverage, IPV may provide some protection from paralysis to the small fraction of children who only receive IPV, but it does not substantially contribute to population immunity to transmission and it may lead to the potential for silent transmission or delayed detection of transmission of LPVs [26–28, 39, 97, 133, 162, 164, 166, 170]. The high cost of IPV also remains an issue, with the relatively high cost of the vaccine and its administration making IPV use not cost-effective. IPV offers an expensive option for post-OPV cessation insurance (i.e. a vaccine that provides protection from paralysis to recipients at a high cost for a virus that is supposed to be gone and does not limit participation in transmission if the virus is not gone or is reintroduced).\nAll of the modeling groups recognized the role of undervaccinated subpopulations in sustaining LPV transmission and recommended focus on these weak links. However, the groups recommended different strategies. Based on the application of its DEB modeling, KRI repeatedly emphasized the need to overcome the failure to vaccinate these subpopulations and to reach all populations with sufficient quantities of tOPV prior to OPV2 cessation, and bOPV after OPV2 cessation to achieve high levels of population immunity to transmission to stop and prevent WPV and cVDPV transmission [36, 38–40, 42, 47, 49, 68, 69, 73, 74]. In contrast, IC emphasized vaccine failure based on its characterization of low OPV efficacy from case–control studies of epidemiological data [82–84, 87–92, 103–108, 114, 115], which led IC to recommend new vaccine tools (e.g. mOPVs, bOPV, IPV) as a way to get around poor programmatic performance. IC and IDM also both focused attention on applying statistical models to characterize population immunity (as they, respectively, defined it for different studies, see note at the bottom of Table 4) and on identifying national and subnational areas that previously performed poorly, for which they recommended temporary shifts or optimization of resources to deal with the failure to vaccinate in some populations [87, 89, 92, 93, 100–102, 109, 111, 131, 140–142]. The differences between the recommendations of the modeling groups with respect to the delays in achieving polio eradication as due to failure to vaccinate vs. due to vaccine failure led to substantially different foci and investments. KRI suggests that chasing better (and often more expensive) tools (e.g. mOPV, IPV) has not helped accelerate global polio eradication, that achieving and maintaining eradication depends on continuing to get enough OPV preventively into susceptible children to stop and prevent the transmission of cVDPVs and/or WPVs (followed by careful and aggressive management of the risks of globally coordinated OPV cessation), and that as of early 2020, the GPEI appears off track [202, 203].\nBuilding on modeling performed prior to 2000 that supported the certification of the Americas as wild poliovirus free [197–199], multiple studies published in 2000–2019 explored the potential of undetected circulation and confidence about no circulation [27, 46, 70, 71, 75, 76, 132, 136, 161, 167–169]. Generally, the modeling studies to date agreed with respect to their recommendations about undetected circulation and high confidence about no circulation after 3 years with no detected evidence of LPV transmission while conducting high-quality surveillance. Although not captured in the review, modeling of one of the last known reservoirs of WPV3 transmission (i.e. Borno and Yobe, Nigeria) published in 2020 [233, 234] also supported the 2019 decision by the Global Certification Commission to certify the global eradication of indigenous WPV3 [235].\nAs the GPEI expanded its use of environmental surveillance, the modeling groups published increasing numbers of studies that included consideration of the information that environmental surveillance provides [43, 46, 67, 71, 75, 76, 117, 136, 145, 147, 162, 166].\nTo date, only KRI considered the risks of iVDPVs [4, 13, 50, 61, 81] and (un)intentional re-introduction risks (e.g. breaches in containment) in its global modeling (see Table 4 for references), although IC recently reviewed the WHO database of known iVDPVs [125].\nKRI represents the only group that published integrated dynamic disease transmission and economic models that prospectively explore(d) the risks, costs, and benefits of strategies and policies to support the GPEI. By design, prospective models represent inherently uncertain projections into the future, and the results and insights from these models are only as good as the assumptions and the underlying available evidence. The KRI dynamic poliovirus transmission models [10, 33, 202] rely on using the available evidence and subject matter expert opinion to characterize the dynamics of poliovirus transmission as a function of differential equations, with consideration of some of the variability that exists among countries based on stratification by WBILs and relevant inputs related to transmission, seasonality, and actual vaccine use. KRI uses a model with high complexity and checks its models retrospectively to ensure that they provide estimates consistent with historical data of cases caused by WPVs and VDPVs, die out, and children with non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NP-AFP) with a history of zero doses of vaccine, and then applies them prospectively to address policy and strategy questions [10, 33, 202]. The KRI poliovirus transmission and OPV evolution model include assumptions about a multi-stage infection process with infection stages of variable infectiousness that impacts the kinetics of infections and die-out and depends on choices about the number of stages used to model OPV evolution. These choices influence the flows of people and timing of transitions between reversion stages, while actual OPV evolution and the emergence of cVDPVs depend on random events and micro-level population dynamics [33, 202]\nIDM developed and applied multiple IB models that also include considerable complexity. The first published IDM IB dynamic transmission model captures within-host susceptibility by exposure to and dose history for LPVs and/or IPV, models shedding durations and concentrations based on the host immunity histories, and assumes fecal-oral transmission among people who share a household as well as through close social contacts outside the household [129, 132, 133]. IDM applied an IB model to reproduce WPV viral shedding in different settings based on historical data [134] and added secondary spread of OPV, reinfection, and waning in some of its IB models [134, 135]. IDM does not model OPV evolution (i.e. the transition from Sabin OPV to cVDPVs) endogenously in its IB modeling [134], although Table 2 notes that IDM included statistical consideration of OPV reversion to cVDPV in one study [133]. IDM recently performed a cost study [146], but has not to date published any studies that integrated dynamic poliovirus transmission modeling with economics. IDM did not report substantial or prohibitive computational expense associated with following many individuals in IB models given the populations that it modeled to date, although IDM reported using a sampling strategy or reduced scope model to avoid computational burden in some of its IB modeling papers [132, 133].\nIC did not consider economics in any of its modeling. As shown in Table 1, IC developed a few SC models and applied them prospectively to address specific questions. However, most of the publications by IC present statistical analyses of existing, retrospective data with a focus on answering specific questions driven by the data. Extrapolation of the results and inferences from statistical models requires assuming that the data collected in the past provide a good representation of the future and directly relate to the question asked. With eradication efforts driving cases to zero, epidemiological models lose their ability to make inferences based on comparing observed retrospective cases for different interventions, because as the polio cases disappear the data become sparse and controlling the data for confounders and other biases becomes difficult. The case–control epidemiological methods used by IC remain highly sensitive to the selection of cases and controls, and any limitations associated with the data used to perform the analyses.\nIn addition, in the context of complex dynamic systems, statistical models can provide relatively poor insight about prospective risks. For example, in the early 2000s, when countries only used tOPV (i.e. no mOPV or bOPV), KRI characterized the risks of cVDPVs using a statistical model [13]. However, a subsequent review of available data demonstrated the inadequacy of this approach following the introduction of mOPV and bOPV, which created substantial immunity gaps for serotype 2, and increased the risks of cVDPV2s [32], which led KRI to add OPV evolution endogenously into its dynamic transmission model [33, 202].\nAs shown in Tables 2 and 3, the models reviewed differed with respect to the populations modeled and the mixing assumptions used. DEB and SC models typically assume homogeneous mixing of individuals in a population, although they may account for preferential mixing by age, subpopulation, or other factors, and include births, deaths, aging, and immigration. Part of the complexity of KRI transmission models comes from the use of population-specific demographic and immunization history data for inputs and the inclusion of preferential mixing by age and/or subpopulation. The inclusion of undervaccinated subpopulations in DEB models probably only partially captures some of the population heterogeneity in under-vaccinated communities, but does so better than ignoring this heterogeneity for some analytical questions.\nIB models seek to capture the full richness of the complexity of transmission, but they do so with considerable computational costs. IB models track each individual in a population, which can offer advantages that include simulating die-out directly, but require many assumptions about the spatial distribution and contact patterns for each individual in the model [24, 41].\nOne limitation of transmission models broadly arises from assumptions about mixing at the model boundaries. Most models characterize transmission within a closed population, but they can allow for importations and exportations of viruses as appropriate [33, 202].\nDEB models use simplified population structures and fractional rate-based processes that allow for fractional individuals, which requires the use of a transmission threshold to simulate die-out [10, 33, 202]. In real populations, the die out of transmission involves some element of chance. For analyses that focus on low levels of transmission and die out (e.g. analyses about the confidence of no undetected circulation), the modeling groups typically apply SC models to simulate the stochasticity of die out, although they have used both types of stochastic simulation approaches.\nRecognizing that all models represent simplifications of reality, we suggest that the polio modeling performed during the past 20 years offered insights on many different aspects of the polio endgame that supported GPEI-partner deliberations and decisions. Although the models developed by independent groups took different approaches, they generally offered similar insights and recommendations. Notably, we found relatively few conflicts between the recommendations made by the modeling groups in the published literature, although the differences in recommendations about some vaccination strategies were substantial (e.g. initial recommendations about tOPV pSIAs in the run-up to OPV2 cessation, IPV use in oSIAs). The review suggests that some of the differences in recommendations may reflect different approaches and use of data. Both KRI and IDM developed comprehensive dynamic transmission model platforms, which they designed, adopted, and applied for use in addressing different questions. The broad and deep nature of polio dynamic transmission models led to the inclusion of significant complexity, which matches the human experience with polio: it is complicated. Notably, the large and multi-component KRI and IDM models required significant time to develop and require a time investment to fully understand. In general, model platforms can offer the advantages of internal consistency and consistency with all of the available evidence, to the extent that they are well calibrated and consider all of the evidence.\nThe polio endgame appears far from over [202], and the potential for modeling to contribute to future polio risk management activities appears promising. The GPEI, now 20 years late in delivering on polio eradication, faces an uncertain path and future. During the next few years, the success or failure of the 2016 globally coordinated OPV2 cessation will become clear, and global health leaders will evaluate their commitments to OPV cessation as a polio endgame strategy [80]. Modeling published in early 2020 suggests that the GPEI remains off track with respect to achieving WPV1 eradication and successful OPV2 cessation [202], although WPV1 eradication remains possible with sufficiently high-intensity OPV vaccination [236, 237]. Further modeling can help to quantify the probability of needing to restart OPV2, which a 2020 statistical analysis [238] and modeling study suggest appears likely [239].\nModeling studies will need to reevaluate the health and economic impacts of the GPEI, if it succeeds, and evaluate the costs and benefits of future poliovirus vaccine options. In the case of a successful OPV cessation, all countries will realize the benefits of a world free of WPVs and cVDPVs, and determine their interest in purchasing the long-term insurance offered by IPV use. We expect that high- and upper middle-income countries will continue to use IPV and increasingly use IPV-containing combination vaccines, albeit at relatively high costs [240]. We also anticipate a continued trend toward the use of IPV-only schedules by these countries, although as long as LPVs continue to circulate, countries at risk of LPV importation will likely continue with sequential IPV/OPV schedules.\nFor relatively lower-income countries, polio vaccine choices appear more complicated. As the risks of continued transmission of LPV2s continue to pose threats to successful OPV2 cessation, questions will arise about OPV cessation as a strategy and about the need for different vaccine options for the polio endgame. Perhaps the most interesting role played by dynamic transmission and economic modeling arises from the opportunities they offer to explore potential future options [61–64]. After many years of research and development, a new and more difficult-to-revert OPV2 strain, which researchers expect will provide the protection of Sabin OPV but lower risks of VAPP and VDPVs, may become a real option [241]. The existence of such new OPV strains will raise important modeling questions about whether countries that currently use OPV will want to shift their polio immunization strategy to use trivalent formulations of such OPV strains, or continue to use IPV. The choices will depend substantially on the costs of the different vaccine options (including national costs of delivery), the risks posed by LPVs, and the effectiveness of the vaccines with respect to providing protection from paralysis and/or transmission. Thus, with respect to different polio vaccine options, the world will look very different if the GPEI succeeds in its efforts to eradicate all WPVs and coordinates global cessation of all OPV than a world with ongoing control using OPV due to continued WPV1 transmission.\nQuestions also remain about the formulations of IPV vaccine that may become available in the future, which will affect future poliovirus vaccine policy modeling and the path of the polio endgame [240]. Currently, most OPV-using countries deliver stand-alone formulations of IPV, although in some cases they use off-label fractional intradermal delivery, which can save substantially on antigen costs, but cost more with respect to administration [230]. Research underway may also provide an IPV vaccine patch option [242–245], which would potentially achieve both dose-sparing of IPV and ease of delivery that could increase coverage, albeit at a potentially higher and uncertain cost. Future modeling could support current efforts to explore greater use of combination vaccines that contain IPV (e.g. adding IPV to current pentavalent vaccines), which offer an opportunity to potentially save some vaccine administration costs by sharing across antigens. However, the actual costs for the IPV component itself may increase due to the added complexity of the vaccine. Moreover, national costs for IPV vaccination will also increase with the use of combination vaccines because the other vaccines in such combination products (i.e. DPT, Heb, and Hib), which require more doses and differ with respect to their ideal schedules (e.g. IPV shows better take rates when given to children after maternal antibodies wane, which occurs after scheduled DPT doses in most current OPV-using countries). To avoid giving extra doses of IPV, countries could adopt schedules that include both pentavalent and hexavalent vaccines, but this adds complexity for both supply chains and administration, which also implies additional costs. Furthermore, combination IPV products use full (i.e. not fractional) IPV doses, which implies no dose sparing. In addition to national preferences, we note that the mix of future poliovirus vaccine options available to developing countries will also depend on the extent to which donors who support immunization for lower-income countries prefer different vaccine options. Modeling may help to support future investment decisions, particularly since all of this complexity and uncertainty imply the potential for insufficient supplies of the desired vaccines given the time delays associated with producing vaccines.\nModeling the polio endgame and particularly the potential for OPV restart can also motivate the exploration of investments in developing new, non-vaccine risk management strategies for the polio endgame. For example, the results of modeling the reveal under-vaccinated subpopulations can lead to the development of better evaluation methods to monitor vaccine delivery (e.g. GPS tracking [246]), surveillance (e.g. GIS settlement mapping [247]), and/or other interventions. As with vaccines, the extent to which countries and donors are willing to invest in future risk management tools and strategies will determine their development pathway and ultimate use. The willingness to support modeling studies will also determine the demand and resources available for future modeling.\nFinally, the COVID-19 virus pandemic will motivate further polio modeling to support the recovery of GPEI functions and options for managing financial and vaccine resources. Modeling also may help the GPEI partners evaluate the combined impacts of the physical distancing efforts made by individuals in some countries, which change mixing and the dynamics of poliovirus transmission, and reduced health system utilization, which decreases the distribution of polio vaccines in RI and/or SIAs and may decrease surveillance.</br></br>UNKNOWN URL AND TITLE</br></br>\nAuthor Information\nAn event is serious (based on the ICH definition) when the patient outcome is:* death* life-threatening* hospitalisation* disability* congenital anomaly* other medically important event\n\nA 61-year-old woman developed Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) during treatment with mycophenolate mofetil, prednisone and tacrolimus as immunosuppressant therapy [routes and durations of treatments to reaction onset not stated].\nThe woman, who had a history of end-stage renal disease because of adult polycystic kidney disease and status post living-related kidney transplant in 2004 at an outside hospital, was referred to the emergency room with fever for 5 days. She also had nausea and diarrhoea, which had resolved by the time of presentation. The diarrhoea and nausea lasted for 5 days. The diarrhoea was watery and non-bloody, occurring about 4 to 5 times a day. Ten days before the admission, she had attended a funeral. The symptoms began after attending a funeral in the city where several people had tested positive for COVID-19. Her medical history was significant for hypertension, histoplasmosis and gout. Her home medications consisted of mycophenolate mofetil 250mg two times a day, tacrolimus 0.5mg two times a day, prednisone 5 mg/day, allopurinol, labetalol, itraconazole and hydralazine. On presentation, she was febrile with 103°F, BP 151/85mm Hg, pulse rate 87 beats per minute, oxygen saturation 92% to 97% on room air and respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute. Physical examination showed that she was in respiratory distress with reduced breath sounds on the left side of her chest. The urinalysis showed 2+ protein, which was new, negative for red blood cells and blood. The chest X-ray showed mild mid to lower lung infiltrate bilaterally, more remarkable on the left. The chest CT with contrast showed few scattered rounded ground glass and consolidative opacities seen within the lingula of the left lung and middle lobe right lung and segmental lung consolidation seen within the dependent portion of both lower lobes.\nThe woman was <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightgreen; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">treated<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">usages</span>\n</mark> with <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightorange; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">azithromycin<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">chemical</span>\n</mark> and ceftriaxone for possible community-acquired pneumonia.

The nucleotide sequencing confirmed the Aspergillus spp.</br></br>UNKNOWN URL AND TITLE</br></br>Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are generic antiviral agents that have shown effectiveness against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus infection, and in this time of pandemic, physicians are trying any plausible approach to therapy.1 News reports have appeared recently about China starting trials with a variety of medications to treat coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) infection, including both of those agents.2 In fact, at least 10 trials have started now in different countries.3 The Chinese are giving a course of CQ, 500 mg twice daily, for up to 10 days, or 400 mg of HCQ 4 times daily, and these extreme doses have raised concerns about retinal damage.\nCQ and HCQ are well known to ophthalmologists because of retinal toxicity after long-term usage for systemic lupus erythematosus and other rheumatoid diseases. Retinopathy is seen infrequently before 10 or more years of usage at the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) recommended dosage of <5 mg/kg real weight.4 However, the doses proposed to treat COVID-19 are 4-5 times higher, and it is important that our specialty be informed whether there is ocular risk from these short-term treatments. Do we need to be worried, and what, if anything, should ophthalmology be doing?\nEven though the Chinese COVID-19 doses are extremely high, they are used for a very brief period of time. High-dose HCQ has been used for other medical treatments. Some rheumatologists have been giving 1,200 mg/day for 6 weeks as a loading dose when starting HCQ therapy for systemic lupus erythematosus, and no visual losses have been reported, although detailed ophthalmologic examinations were not performed.5\n,\n6 Two trials of treatment of myeloma and solid tumors used 1,200 mg/day for 4-8 weeks, and again no visual loss was reported.7\n,\n8 The only high-dose ophthalmologic study by Leung and associates9 followed 7 patients at 3-month intervals for 7-25 months while using 1,000 mg/day HCQ therapy for small-cell lung cancer. By patient weight, these doses were 3-5 times greater than that recommended by the AAO. Two patients developed subtle and suggestive changes on optical coherence tomography in the parafoveal ellipsoid zone after 11 and 17 months and definitive toxicity after 15 and 25 months. None of the other patients showed damage. Thus, evidence to date indicates that extreme doses do accelerate retinal toxicity but with a probable time course of many months rather than days.\nAs this is being written, other reports are coming out that may alter the landscape of CQ and HCQ usage, and more reports will show up by the time this one is published. For example, a prepublication just appeared of a small French trial of 22 COVID-19-positive patients using 600 mg/day HCQ for 10 days to reduce the viral load.10 The number of polymerase chain reaction-positive cases fell nearly 50% relative to those of controls and dropped to nearly zero if <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightorange; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">azithromycin<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">chemical</span>\n</mark> was added. The HCQ dosage of 600 mg/day is only approximately twice that recommended by the AAO, on average, and should present no risk of retinopathy in this time frame. News media are now also citing interest in the use of CQ or HCQ intermittently as prophylaxis, much like the use for malaria, although doses have not been mentioned.\nOphthalmologists should judge all of this evolving information in light of well-established knowledge about dose, weight, and duration as the primary determinants of risk of retinopathy.11 Older studies used to cite 1,000 g/day as a “toxic” dose of HCQ, but measurements of absolute usage are misleading with respect to retinopathy because toxicity relates to dose by weight.4\n,\n11 People come in all sizes, and 400 mg means something very different in terms of risk to a small woman than it does to a large man. Short-term trials (less than 2 weeks) will have negligible risk, even with doses 5-6 times the usual recommended maximum dosage of 5 mg/kg/day. Usage for a few months will still have very low risk with doses less than 3-4 times the usual level. However, if physicians suggest using these drugs for a year or more, I would strongly advise staying within the AAO recommendation and screening the patient annually.\nThe bottom line: I do not believe ophthalmic screening is necessary for COVID-19 patients who take CQ or HCQ for less than 2 weeks as antiviral therapy, because the likelihood of retinal damage is exceedingly low, even with high doses. In a time of pandemic with worldwide shortages of medical personnel, funds, hospital beds, equipment, screening tests, and proven therapy, it would be counter-productive (and raise inappropriate fears) to suggest the addition of labor-intensive and expensive eye examinations that are of low yield. However, as new protocols arise, these steps will need to be evaluated relative to the risk of retinopathy that their particular doses and durations of use may pose. Ophthalmologists will be most effective in this time of crisis by reassuring physicians and the public where retinopathy is not a serious concern with respect to CQ or HCQ usage for coronavirus.</br></br>UNKNOWN URL AND TITLE</br></br>\nAuthor Information\nAn event is serious (based on the ICH definition) when the patient outcome is:* death* life-threatening* hospitalisation* disability* congenital anomaly* other medically important event\n\nA 65-year-old man developed haemolysis, that lead to acute renal failure during off-label treatment with hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19.\nThe man was admitted to the hospital for hypoxia in mid-march 2020.

Investigations on day 5 revealed that the haptoglobin was below detection level, indicating severe haemolysis.\nThe man's therapy with hydroxychloroquine was discontinued on day 5 of its initiation. It was later revealed that he had glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency (G6PD was found to be below 0.2 U/g of Hb). He developed acute respiratory distress syndrome due to COVID-19, for which he required intubation for 7 days. He underwent continuous veno-venous haemodialysis and filtration during the ICU stay. The Hb further dropped to 7.2 g/dL. He received multiple blood transfusions. The haptoglobin again became detectable on day 15 after initiation of hydroxychloroquine. The acute haemolysis was considered to be due to use of hydroxychloroquine and the underlying G6PD deficiency, that further lead to acute renal failure.

Additionally, he developed leukopenia and neutropenia during off label treatment with tocilizumab for COVID-19 pneumonia [not all routes stated; duration of treatments to reactions onsets not stated].\nThe man had undergone kidney transplantation from a deceased donor in 2005 for end-stage renal disease due to chronic interstitial nephritis. Later, he was admitted for shivering and persistent fever for over 48 hours. He had chronic kidney disease stage IIIa and was on maintenance immunosuppression with ciclosporin [cyclosporine A] and oral methylprednisolone. At first examination, peripheral capillary oxygen saturation was 97% breathing ambient air, BP was 136/72mm Hg and body temperature was 38°C. Laboratory blood tests were normal with minimally elevated C-reactive protein, mild acute kidney injury. Chest radiography showed minimal left pleural effusion. Urinary cultures showed urinary tract infection and he started receiving meropenem. On day 3 after admission, SARS-CoV-2 infection was suspected because of the negativity of urinary cultures and serum procalcitonin and persistence of fever. Then, he was isolated in a single room. Treatment with meropenem was stopped, oropharyngeal/nasal swab for SARS-CoV-2 was performed. He was found to have bilateral basal interstitial pneumonia in chest radiograph, arterial blood gases were unremarkable partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) was 91mm Hg breathing ambient air. A third attempt for SARS-CoV-2 test on day 9 after admission test was found positive, and COVID-19 pneumonia was confirmed. On the day of COVID-19 diagnosis, his arterial pO2 dropped to 57mm Hg and low-flow oxygen through nasal cannula. He then started receiving hydroxychloroquine 200mg twice daily and ciclosporin dose was reduced by a half. Additionally, he was started on unspecified IV fluids. Laboratory exams showed lymphopenia and leukopenia. After 2 days, due to lack of improvement in his clinical conditions, ciclosporin was stopped and oral methylprednisolone dose was increased to 16 mg/day. Subsequently, off label treatment with SC tocilizumab 324mg was also started. His interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in blood were found to be high (280.86 pg/mL). He developed progressive leukopenia. Under suspicion of tocilizumab-related leukopenia (leukocyte nadir at 660 /μL) with neutropenia (neutrophils 400 /μL), and to enhance anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory response, he was treated with IV immunoglobulin (IVIG) 0.3 g/kg. His leukocyte count increased to 2090 /μL (lymphocytes 670 /μL and neutrophils 1180 /μL) and CD4 count to 518 /μL. On day 14 after hospitalisation, urinary culture showed positive for multiresistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and antibiotic treatment with meropenem was restarted.

The radiographic imaging showed evolution of COVID-19 pneumonia. Since tocilizumab administration, he remained to be apyretic. A progressive improvement was noted in his arterial pO2 levels always above 60mm Hg and oxygen treatment was stopped. The level of IL-6 also increased to 619.11 pg/mL as expected, 6 days after receiving tocilizumab.\nThe man was discharged home on day 22 with no fever. At that time, his peripheral oxygen saturation was 95% breathing ambient air, WBC was 2970 /μL, respiratory frequency was 14 acts/minute and BP was 140/80mm Hg. Oropharyngeal/nasal swab for SARS-Cov-2 still showed positive at day 13 after diagnosis. He was suggested appropriate isolation measures at home. The treatment with hydroxychloroquine was stopped 13 day after its initiation, and ciclosporin was still withheld.</br></br>UNKNOWN URL AND TITLE</br></br>To the Editor:\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) affects adults predominantly, with the greatest number of admissions to the intensive care unit (ICU) and highest mortality found in this age group.1 Although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children has been described as being less severe with a shorter recovery time,2 we present the case of a female patient aged 16 years, previously healthy and with no known contacts with COVID-19, that suffered severe pneumonia due to infection by SARS-CoV-2 requiring veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and experienced a full recovery.\nThe patient presented to the emergency department of the regional hospital in her area with cough and fever of 6 days’ duration. The chest radiograph evinced pneumonia (Fig. 1\nA), which prompted admission to the inpatient ward.

On the same day, the condition of the patient worsened, as she developed tachycardia, tachypnoea, dyspnoea, fever (39.9 °C) and her oxygen saturation (SaO2) dropped to 90% (4 L/min of supplemental oxygen). The patient was transferred to the ICU and immediately required orotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation (Fig. 1B). In the 72 h that followed, the patient was managed with neuromuscular blocking agents, a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 12–14 cmH2O, inhaled nitric oxide and ventilation in the prone position (2 sessions). After 4 days in the PICU, the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) and the PaO2/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) worsened (the latter dropped to 70 mmHg for 6 h), which prompted activation of the mobile ECMO team of the tertiary care referral hospital in our autonomous community. The patient was connected to a portable ECMO system (Cardiohelp®, Maquet Cardiopulmonary AG, Hirrlingen, Germany) with a femoral-jugular veno-venous configuration (Fig. 1C): 21 F multistage drainage cannula and 19 F return cannula.\nAfter connection to the ECMO system, the patient was transferred to the ICU of the referral hospital. On arrival, she had a heart rate of 77 bpm and a blood pressure of 131/61 mmHg with administration of noradrenaline at a dose of 0.1 μg/kg/minute. She received ventilation with a tidal volume of 3 mL/kg of body weight, a FiO2 of 50% and a PEEP of 14 cmH2O. The initial ECMO blood flow was 4.2 L/min with a FiO2 of 100% (with a sweep of 4 L/min). The salient findings were lymphopaenia, marked elevation of interleukin 6, C-reactive protein, ferritin and d-dimer levels, and a negative troponin test (Table 1\n). At admission in the ICU of our referral hospital, we initiated treatment with tocilizumab (initial dose of 600 mg followed by 400 mg/12 h after), methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg/24 h, 3 doses) and switched antiviral treatment to remdesivir (initial dose of 200 mg followed by 100 mg/24 h for 4 days).\nThe patient responded favourably. The levels of proinflammatory cytokines went down and pulmonary function improved: increase in the PaO2:FiO2 ratio and improvement in dynamic compliance with a lower PEEP (Table 1). After 180 h, it became possible to discontinue ECMO and extubate the patient. After 8 days in the ICU and 7 in the inpatient ward of the referral hospital, the patient was discharged home without need of supplemental oxygen and was able to walk unassisted (negative PCR test for SARS-CoV-2) (Fig. 1D).\nExtracorporeal membrane oxygenation should be considered salvage therapy in cases refractory to conventional mechanical ventilation, ventilation in the prone position and/or recruitment manoeuvres.3 The frequency of ECMO utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic has been of 0.5%–1% of all hospitalised patients. In Europe, as of May 7, 2020, 1068 adult patients have required support with ECMO.4 Although cases of pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 have been reported in infants5, children6 and young adults,1 these patients have generally had good outcomes and rarely required extracorporeal life support. Our patient developed severe pneumonia refractory to standard therapy and required ECMO. The European Survey of Neonatal/Paediatric COVID-19 Patients in ECMO includes few patients, including ours.4 Adult patients with COVID-19 need between 20 and 50 days of ECMO to recover. In the case of our patient, 7 days of ECMO sufficed to maintain oxygenation and allowed delivery of ultra-protective ventilation until the inflammatory response abated. We did not detect any adverse effects of the combination of antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatments used in the patient. We also did not need to adjust the usual dosage, so we surmise that there were no pharmacokinetic alterations associated with the use of the circuit or the extracorporeal membrane.\nMany articles published during the current pandemic describe the course of disease in patients that remain in the ICU (even under ECMO). Ours is the first case of a paediatric patient managed with veno-venous ECMO that has fully recovered and been discharged home free of sequelae. In this case, extracorporeal life support proved safe (including an interhospital transfer), so it can be contemplated as an option in children and adolescents for management of COVID-19 if their condition requires such support.</br></br>UNKNOWN URL AND TITLE</br></br>Hydroxychloroquine [Plaquenil] is associated with a risk of QT interval prolongation and drug interactions when used in the management of COVID-19, warns the Malaysian National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency (NPRA).\nHydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with other drugs is not approved for the treatment of COVID-19, but has been used off-label for this infection. It has been documented to cause dose-dependent QT interval prolongation, and is associated with a risk of cardiac adverse events (AEs) which is increased when the drug is used in patients receiving other drugs which prolong the QT interval (antiarrhythmics, tricyclic antidepressants, antipsychotics and anti-infectives including <mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: lightorange; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">azithromycin<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">chemical</span>\n</mark> ), and in patients with pre-existing conditions which potentiate the risk of QT interval prolongation (heart disease, heart failure, myocardial infarction, bradycardia, hypocalcaemia, hypokalaemia and/or hypomagnesaemia, or a history of ventricular arrhythmias). Serious and life-threatening AEs reported after the use of hydroxychloroquine in patients with COVID-19 include QT interval prolongation, torsades de pointes, syncope, heart arrest and sudden death.\nHydroxychloroquine is also associated with known drug interactions with antacids; CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 inhibitors including cimetidine, clarithromycin, clopidogrel, gemfibrozil, itraconazole, ritonavir and grapefruit juice; and CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 inducers including carbamazepine, hypericum (St John's Wort), phenobarbital and rifampicin. It has an inhibitory effect on P-glycoprotein substrates including ciclosporin, dabigatran and digoxin.\nThe NPRA has approved a Direct Healthcare Professional Communication issued by Sanofi-aventis (Malaysia) regarding this safety concern.</br></br>",

        "example_text = \"Unfortunately, no drug or vaccine has yet been approved to treat human coronaviruses. Several options can be envisaged to control or prevent emerging infections of 2019-nCoV, including vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, oligonucleotide-based therapies, peptides, interferon therapies and small-molecule drugs. However, new interventions are likely to require months to years to develop. Given the urgency of the 2019-nCoV outbreak, we focus here on the potential to repurpose existing antiviral agents approved or in development for treating infections caused by HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and influenza1, based on therapeutic experience with two other infections caused by human coronaviruses: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).Virally targeted agents. Approved nucleoside analogues (favipiravir and ribavirin) and experimental nucleoside analogues (remdesivir and galidesivir) may have potential against 2019-nCoV. Nucleoside analogues in the form of adenine or guanine derivatives target the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and block viral RNA synthesis in a broad spectrum of RNA viruses, including human coronaviruses4. Favipiravir (T-705), a guanine analogue approved for influenza treatment, can effectively inhibit the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of RNA viruses such as influenza, Ebola, yellow fever, chikungunya, norovirus and enterovirus4, and a recent study reported its activity against 2019-nCoV (EC50 = 61.88 μM in Vero E6 cells)5. Patients with 2019-nCoV are being recruited in randomized trials to evaluate the efficacy of favipiravir plus interferon-α (ChiCTR2000029600) and favipiravir plus baloxavir marboxil (an approved influenza inhibitor targeting the cap-dependent endonuclease) (ChiCTR2000029544). Ribavirin is a guanine derivative approved for treating HCV and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) that has been evaluated in patients with SARS and MERS, but its side effects such as anaemia may be severe at high doses2 and whether it offers sufficient potency against 2019-nCoV is uncertain. Remdesivir (GS-5734) is a phosphoramidate prodrug of an adenine derivative with a chemical structure similar to that of tenofovir alafenamide, an approved HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitor. Remdesivir has broad-spectrum activities against RNA viruses such as MERS and SARS in cell cultures and animal models, and has been tested in a clinical trial for Ebola. A recent study reported that remdesivir inhibited 2019-nCoV (EC50 = 0.77 μM in Vero E6 cells)5, and a US patient with 2019-nCoV recovered after receiving intravenous remdesivir in January6. Two phase III trials were initiated in early February to evaluate intravenous remdesivir (200 mg on day 1 and 100 mg once daily for 9 days) in patients with 2019-nCoV (NCT04252664 and NCT04257656), with estimated completion dates in April 2020. Galidesivir (BCX4430), an adenosine analogue that was originally developed for HCV, is currently in early-stage clinical studies evaluating its safety in healthy subjects and its efficacy against yellow fever, and has shown antiviral activities in preclinical studies against many RNA viruses, including SARS and MERS2.\""

            "“Validation of new immunologic tests ain’t easy,” it’s been said; validation of new tests for human antibodies to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a particularly daunting task. While we endure months of disruption to daily life prompted by the ongoing pandemic, serologic testing for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 has now come to the limelight. SARS-CoV-2 is a highly contagious and acute severe respiratory pathogen that has produced an enormous strain on health care resources. In the United States and many other countries, specific social behavior restrictions have been enacted to moderate the impact of rapid propagation of this contagion (ie, “flatten the curve”). Scientific experts, governmental officials, and other professionals have publicly advocated for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing to identify individuals who have developed immunity and therefore could potentially reenter the workplace safely despite ongoing high prevalence of the virus. A test for detecting “immune” individuals who will not be reinfected and who will not infect others is an appealing concept, but is it realistic?\n",
            "The temporary easing of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) marketing/use regulations has enabled the rapid expansion of accurate, fast, and reliable nucleic acid tests to identify acute infection with SARS-CoV-2. Laboratory professionals, diagnostic companies, suppliers, investigators, and hospital administrators have all stepped up to manage acute supply shortages for critical testing components including instruments, test-compatible swabs, and nucleic acid extraction kits, ensuring continued availability of reliable and timely test results. As we approach the peak of severe disease prevalence in several regions (according to comprehensive models developed by epidemiologists and statisticians), we now are faced with a new laboratory crisis: SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing.\n",
            "Numerous antibody tests have recently become available. Serologic tests for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 are typically based on lateral flow immunochromatography or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Currently available tests predominantly target antibodies to 1 of 2 main surface proteins of the novel coronavirus – the nucleocapsid protein (N) and the spike protein (S). Several assays focus on the S1 subunit of the spike protein, which is somewhat specific to each coronavirus strain.1,2 The S1 subunits host the binding domain for the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is thought to be the mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into cells.1 Because the S1 subunit is highly immunogenic and its affinity for the ACE2 receptor appears to correlate with infectivity,1 it has been the target for SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays with reportedly high sensitivity and specificity.2,3\n",
            "Clinical implementation urgently requires validation of these new assays. Since real-life performance data are scarce, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been marked by an inspiring level of interlaboratory collaboration. At Yale-New Haven Hospital, we are particularly grateful for invaluable discussions and sharing of data with Johns Hopkins, Massachusetts General Hospital, Mount Sinai, NYU-Langone, Cornell/Columbia, ARUP, Mayo Clinic, and many others. Scientific journals have contributed via the rapid dissemination of curated studies, and preprint sites offer additional information that can be scrutinized in a shorter time frame, prior to dedicated reviewer analysis. The accumulation and exchange of valuable laboratory evidence has increased our understanding of the serologic testing landscape in a short period of time. As a result, we now know that individuals with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection will generally not have detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 within the first 7 days of the onset of symptoms.3,4 The majority of hospitalized SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals with confirmed viral RNA will have detectable IgG antibodies 14 days, and more certainly 28 days, after the onset of symptoms with assay sensitivity and specificity in the high 90 percents.5 Total antibody concentration appears to rise to detectable levels first; IgM and IgA both rise 1 to 2 days earlier than IgG3 (unpublished observations). Preliminary data suggests older individuals produce more robust antibody responses. Assays differ in overall performance, but several methods being validated by large laboratories appear comparable. One might therefore ask: “What, exactly, is the problem?”\n",
            "As valuable as this information is, it may be insufficient to support critical decisions that providers, managers, administrators, and governmental agencies will face, especially regarding immunity in individuals who have remained asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic during the pandemic.\n",
            "To determine whether an individual is immune to SARS-CoV-2, we must know the pretest probability in the specific population being tested, as well as the sensitivity and specificity for protective antibodies of the assay. A significant challenge is that, to date, serologic data are largely limited to hospitalized, ill patients. There is reason to suspect that serologic findings in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic exposures may not correlate as well as in hospitalized patients, particularly as anecdotal evidence suggests individuals with low viral loads produce lower antibody titers (unpublished data).\n",
            "In addition, assessment of antibody effectiveness is problematic even in seriously ill patients. Approximately one-third of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients who developed antibodies during hospitalization have been reported to lack antibodies that neutralize virus in plaque growth assays, considered the standard laboratory test for antibody effectiveness.6 This implies an individual with antibodies may not be immune to reinfection.\n",
            "Finally, a positive antibody result (in a potentially immune individual) does not guarantee noninfectious status; there may be continuing active viral shedding, particularly if their antibodies are nonneutralizing. The molecular heterogeneity of SARS-CoV-2 subtypes,7 could also have an effect on the sensitivity and specificity of serologic assays. The imperfect performance of comparable, more established, serologic tests for other diseases (eg, toxoplasma IgM) may be acceptable because we have a much better understanding of the clinical scenarios. Unfortunately, the same confidence does not hold true for SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing.\n",
            "Quality will play a pivotal role in ensuring we are able to obtain the data required to understand COVID-19 immunity. Some of the serologic tests currently available are simply bound to be inferior and that needs to be documented. The United Kingdom abandoned large-scale purchasing of test kits when the kits failed to satisfy minimum validation metrics.8 Predictably, online direct-to-consumer tests are being aggressively marketed without any published information to evaluate their clinical performance.9 While some antigenic targets have shown minimal cross-reactivity with the 4 prevalent non-SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses,2 without validation studies there is a real risk that some assays may simply reflect prior exposure to the common cold. Fortunately, reputable commercial entities with experienced scientists, sophisticated equipment, and good manufacturing practices have begun to release serologic assays under FDA guidance. Commercial assays typically undergo extensive prerelease standardization, including testing for interferences and matrix effects, quality control, and test results in large patient cohorts. This sets the stage for acquisition of clinical and epidemiologic data.\n",
            "But concerns remain when proposals call for testing populations different from those used to validate the assay. What if a health care worker (HCW) who had a fever and no other symptoms 14 days ago wants to return to work and tests positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies; can we assume with high confidence that this HCW is both immune and noninfectious? If we are wrong, then we have placed patients and coworkers at risk. A failed prevention is also likely to erode faith in the integrity of laboratory tests for the disease. We have heard the argument that any testing is better than none, providing a path to restoring normalcy, and the lack of which has high ongoing societal costs. As laboratory professionals, we can only respond that for anti-SARS-CoV-2 serology: (1) bad assays will always be counterproductive; (2) good assays have not been proven in the proposed test population; and (3) more experience is needed to help us properly interpret the serologic test results.\n",
            "Regulatory and health officials appear to recognize these limitations; eg, return to work guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently do not include serologic testing. The role of serologic testing in identifying potential donors for convalescent plasma remains to be fully investigated (as does the therapeutic benefit of such an intervention in this setting), but other uses for serologic testing may emerge. One such clinical scenario where SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays may be particularly useful is when a positive serology is accompanied by repeatedly negative nucleic acid testing in the setting of a highly suggestive clinical presentation; serology may provide the basis for specific therapies for COVID-19 infection. Still, until we understand the patterns of antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic individuals, and the correlation of antibody response with susceptibility to reinfection, it seems prudent to apply caution to the criteria used to frame economic, social, and corporate policy.\n",
            "Biological variability is the bane of clinical pathology; in the setting of validation and clinical application of serologic testing, this variability presents a daily struggle. Reputable diagnostic companies and both commercial and academic clinical laboratories have repeatedly demonstrated that the value of dedication to testing quality ensures clinical utility. Health industry manufacturing experts, engineers, quality and regulatory managers, sales professionals, scientists, and physicians have been working diligently under significant duress during the COVID-19 pandemic, to the great benefit of society. As laboratory medicine professionals, we must now leverage these efforts by ensuring that: (1) serologic tests for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies perform as well as intended; and (2) we provide information that enables health care providers, administrators, and health officials to best interpret and apply the available evidence. At this point in the evolution of serologic testing for SARS-CoV-2, we must say in unison “caveat emptor.”\n",
